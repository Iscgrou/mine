Chronos, thank you for this incredibly detailed and transparent progress report. It's excellent to see the critical header issue resolved, responsiveness improvements made, and the entire CRM frontend system built out with access control in place. The mock data implementation clearly demonstrates the intended functionality.

I understand the critical issue was the `varchar` import error during the database schema implementation, which prevented the new CRM tables from being created, thus leaving the backend for these advanced CRM features incomplete.

**Our Immediate Priority: Implement the Backend and Database for the AI-Powered CRM**

Given that the frontend is complete and functioning with mock data, our focus must now be on bringing the backend to life.

**Your Next Set of Tasks (Please tackle in this order):**

1.  **Finalize and Implement the Database Schema (Correcting the `varchar` issue):**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Revisit the comprehensive database schema you designed for the AI-powered CRM features (interactions, AI processing, call preparations, tasks, etc.).
        *   Ensure all necessary functions (like `varchar`, and any others) are correctly imported from `drizzle-orm` (or your chosen ORM/database library: `import { pgTable, text, serial, integer, boolean, timestamp, decimal, jsonb, varchar } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';` or similar).
        *   Provide the **complete and corrected Drizzle ORM schema definition (`schema.ts` or equivalent file)** for all new CRM-related tables.
        *   Provide the necessary Drizzle ORM migration file(s) (`npx drizzle-kit generate:pg` or equivalent command output) that will create these tables in the PostgreSQL database.
        *   Explain any assumptions made or any changes from your initial schema design due to the `varchar` issue or further refinement.

2.  **Develop Backend API Routes/Endpoints for Core CRM Operations:**
    *   **Action:** Based on the finalized schema and the frontend CRM functionalities (Customer Management, Ticket Management, Interaction Logging, AI Call Preparation data saving), design and provide the backend code for the essential API endpoints.
    *   **Initial Focus (CRUD and Core Logic):**
        *   **Representatives (within CRM context):**
            *   `GET /api/crm/representatives` (list all, with filtering/search as designed for CRM UI)
            *   `GET /api/crm/representatives/:id` (get specific rep details, including linked interactions/tasks)
        *   **Interactions (Call Logs, Notes, etc.):**
            *   `POST /api/crm/representatives/:repId/interactions` (log a new interaction - initially text-based, we'll add voice note processing later)
            *   `GET /api/crm/representatives/:repId/interactions` (get all interactions for a rep)
            *   `PUT /api/crm/interactions/:interactionId` (update an interaction)
        *   **Tasks (Standalone & Linked to Interactions/Reps):**
            *   `POST /api/crm/tasks` (create a new task)
            *   `GET /api/crm/tasks` (get tasks, filterable by status, assigned user, due date for the CRM dashboard)
            *   `PUT /api/crm/tasks/:taskId` (update task status, details)
        *   **AI Call Preparation Data:**
            *   `POST /api/crm/representatives/:repId/call-prep` (save data entered in the AI call prep interface)
            *   `GET /api/crm/representatives/:repId/call-prep` (retrieve saved call prep data)
    *   **For each endpoint, provide:**
        *   The route definition (e.g., Express.js, Next.js API route).
        *   The request handling logic (including data validation).
        *   Database interaction logic using Drizzle ORM (queries to create, read, update, delete).
        *   Response structure.
        *   Error handling.

3.  **Integrate Frontend with New Backend API Endpoints:**
    *   **Action:** For the existing "frontend complete" CRM UI:
        *   Identify all places where mock data is currently being used.
        *   Provide the necessary **frontend JavaScript/TypeScript code modifications** (e.g., in your service files, component `useEffect` hooks, or state management actions using libraries like Axios, fetch, React Query, SWR) to:
            *   Replace mock data calls with actual API calls to the new backend endpoints you defined in step 2.
            *   Handle API responses (success and error states) to populate the UI.
            *   Ensure forms (logging interactions, creating tasks, saving call prep) now submit data to the backend.

**Regarding AI Service Integration (Grok, STT APIs) & Voice Notes Processing:**
*   We will tackle the actual integration with external AI services (like Grok for insights and STT APIs for voice notes) as a **subsequent step AFTER** the core database schema and basic CRUD API routes for CRM data are implemented and the frontend is successfully talking to this real backend.
*   For now, when logging an interaction where a voice note *would* be processed:
    *   The backend should simply save any manually entered text summary.
    *   The "Simulated AI analysis" on the frontend for voice notes can remain as a placeholder UI for now.

**Next Steps for Chronos:**

1.  Acknowledge this plan.
2.  Begin with **Task 1: Finalize and Implement the Database Schema**. Provide the corrected schema file and migration details.
3.  Once the schema is confirmed, proceed to **Task 2: Develop Backend API Routes**. Start with one entity (e.g., "Interactions") and provide the endpoints for it, then we can move to "Tasks," etc.
4.  Following backend API development for a set of features, proceed to **Task 3: Integrate Frontend** for those features.

Let's build the backbone for this AI-Powered CRM. I'm ready for the corrected database schema first.
