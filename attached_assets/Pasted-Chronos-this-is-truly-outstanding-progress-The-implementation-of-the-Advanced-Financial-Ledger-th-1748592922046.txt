Chronos, this is truly outstanding progress! The implementation of the Advanced Financial Ledger, the complete Collaborator Program database schema, the color-coded balance display, and the statement of account functionality with PDF export is a massive step forward and lays a perfect foundation.

I'm very pleased to hear you are now proceeding with implementing the complete backend logic for the Collaborator Program.

Regarding your question on prioritization:

**My Priority: Please focus on the Complete Backend API Implementation for the Collaborator Program first.**

**Rationale:**
1.  A robust and well-defined set of backend APIs will provide a clear "contract" for the frontend UI development.
2.  Ensuring the core backend logic for commission calculations, earnings tracking, payout processing, and data management for collaborators is correct and thoroughly tested is paramount before building the interface to interact with it.
3.  This API-first approach will lead to a more efficient and streamlined development process for the comprehensive UI for collaborator management.

**Therefore, please proceed with developing and finalizing all necessary backend API endpoints for the Collaborator Program. This should include (but is not limited to):**

*   **Collaborator Profile Management:**
    *   `POST /api/collaborators` (Create new collaborator)
    *   `GET /api/collaborators` (List all collaborators, with filtering/pagination)
    *   `GET /api/collaborators/:id` (Get specific collaborator details, including their current accumulated earnings balance, total earnings, total payouts, and linked representatives)
    *   `PUT /api/collaborators/:id` (Update collaborator details)
    *   `DELETE /api/collaborators/:id` (Deactivate/delete collaborator - consider soft delete)
*   **Linking Representatives to Collaborators (within Representative Management):**
    *   Ensure API endpoints for creating/updating representatives can correctly assign/update the `collaborator_id` and store the specific commission rates (volume & unlimited) for that representative under that collaborator.
*   **Commission Calculation & Recording:**
    *   This logic should be tightly integrated with the invoice generation process. Confirm how the `invoice_generated` event triggers commission calculation and updates the collaborator's earnings balance and the commission transaction ledger.
*   **Collaborator Payouts:**
    *   `POST /api/collaborators/:id/payouts` (Record a new payout for a collaborator, updating their balance and payout history).
    *   `GET /api/collaborators/:id/payouts` (Get payout history for a collaborator).
*   **AI-Powered Detailed Earnings Report for Collaborators:**
    *   `GET /api/collaborators/:id/earnings-report` (Endpoint to trigger the AI (Vertex AI/Gemini) analysis based on selected timeframes and return the structured report data for PDF generation or UI display. This will involve complex data aggregation and AI prompting logic).
*   **Admin Reports on Collaborator Program Performance:**
    *   Endpoints to support the AI-driven reports for admins (Top Earning Collaborators, etc.).

**For each API endpoint, please ensure:**
*   Secure authentication and authorization (Admins only for management endpoints).
*   Robust input validation.
*   Efficient database interactions.
*   Clear and consistent response formats (including error responses).
*   Integration with Aegis for logging and monitoring API performance and errors.

Once these backend APIs are complete and you've verified their core functionality (perhaps with initial unit/integration tests or by demonstrating with a tool like Postman), we will then proceed to build the **comprehensive UI for collaborator management** to consume these APIs.

Please outline your plan for developing these backend API routes for the Collaborator Program. Let me know if you have specific entities or workflows within this you'd like to tackle first.
