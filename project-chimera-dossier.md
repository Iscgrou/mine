# MarFanet Platform - Complete System Dossier for Gemini 2.5 Pro Analysis

## EXECUTIVE BRIEFING FOR GEMINI 2.5 PRO

**Your Role**: Master System Re-Architect, Diagnostic Specialist, and Optimization Virtuoso
**Mission**: Perform exhaustive layer-by-layer analysis to identify ALL functional discrepancies, security vulnerabilities, logical flaws, and optimization opportunities in the MarFanet platform.
**Critical Mandate**: Assume dual personas of MarFanet Admin and CRM user throughout analysis. Identify both stated and unstated bugs through comparison of intended functionality versus actual code implementation.

## I. BUSINESS MODEL & MARKET CONTEXT

MarFanet operates as a comprehensive management platform for V2Ray-based proxy service resellers in Iran. The platform serves mobile phone stores (Representatives) who purchase volume-based and unlimited VPN subscriptions, then resell these services to end-customers.

**Core Business Flow**:
1. Representatives purchase subscriptions from MarFanet (volume-based GB packages or unlimited time-based)
2. MarFanet generates automated invoices with dynamic pricing
3. Representatives resell individual subscriptions to end-customers
4. Platform tracks financial flows, commissions, and performance metrics

**Market Challenges**:
- Operating in Iran's restricted internet environment where VPN services are essential
- Managing complex pricing structures (limited GB-based vs unlimited time-based subscriptions)
- Handling Persian language requirements with technical V2Ray terminology
- Processing high-volume financial transactions in Toman currency
- Coordinating between multiple stakeholders (admins, representatives, end-customers)

**Current Scale**: 96 active representatives, processing substantial monthly revenue through automated systems.

## III. CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE

**Frontend Stack**:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Wouter for client-side routing
- TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components
- React Query (TanStack) for state management
- Framer Motion for animations

**Backend Stack**:
- Express.js with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Session-based authentication
- RESTful API design
- JSON-based data exchange

**AI Integration**:
- Google Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) - TARGET SYSTEM
- Complete replacement of legacy "Grok" model references

**Database Schema** (Critical for Analysis):
```sql
-- Core tables with full relationships
representatives (96 active records)
invoices (generated automatically from JSON imports)
invoice_items (detailed subscription breakdowns)
collaborators (affiliate program management)
commission_records (automated calculations)
financial_ledger (comprehensive transaction tracking)
settings (system configuration)
crm_users (team member management)
crm_interactions (customer communication logs)
crm_ai_processing_queue (AI analysis queue)
```

## IV. CRITICAL LEGACY SYSTEM ERADICATION REQUIREMENTS

**Complete Removal Required**:
1. All "Grok" AI model references and logic
2. "Secret URL path" authentication system
3. Any hardcoded access methods

**Replacement Requirements**:
1. Robust username/password authentication
   - Admin: mgr/m867945
   - CRM: crm/c867945
2. Session management with proper security
3. Complete migration to Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

---

## V. RECENTLY RESOLVED ISSUES (BASELINE FOR ANALYSIS)

1. **ODS to JSON Migration**: Successfully processed 244 representative records
2. **Database Precision**: Increased financial field precision to 15 digits for large amounts
3. **Missing CRM Tables**: Restored crm_ai_processing_queue, crm_interaction_types, crm_knowledge_base
4. **Invoice Template System**: Rebuilt with proper settings integration
5. **Representatives Balance API**: Stabilized calculation logic
6. **Data Import Processing**: Fixed JSON parsing for PHPMyAdmin export format

---

## VI. CURRENT AI INTERACTION PROMPTS & LOGIC

**CRM Psyche-Insights System**:
```typescript
// Current implementation uses placeholder structure
// REQUIRES: Complete migration to Vertex AI with contextual prompts
```

**Harmonic Voice Intelligence**:
