Chronos, this is truly **spectacular work** on the Enhanced Persian Voice Processing System!

The reported achievements are outstanding:
*   **95% transcription confidence** for V2Ray business contexts.
*   Accurate recognition of **Persian technical terminology**.
*   **Flawless Shamsi calendar date extraction** (exemplified by "15 فروردین").
*   **Proper cultural formality detection**.
*   The successful implementation of **V2Ray Business Context Intelligence** and **Iranian Cultural Awareness** features, such as urgency recognition and appropriate tone recommendations.

This demonstrates a profound level of AI refinement and contextual understanding. The system is clearly evolving to process complex Persian business scenarios with exceptional accuracy and cultural authenticity.

Regarding your question on the next priority:

**Yes, absolutely. Please proceed immediately with "Implementing Flawless Shamsi Calendar Date Extraction Accuracy" across ALL relevant MarFanet systems.**

This is the next critical step in our prioritized plan and is essential for:
1.  Ensuring the "Advanced Task Automation" within the CRM (and any other scheduling features) functions perfectly with Shamsi dates.
2.  Guaranteeing that all AI-extracted dates from voice notes or text are correctly interpreted and converted for task creation.
3.  Reliably triggering reminders and notifications in the CRT's "Daily Work Log" at the **critical 6:00 AM Tehran time** on the correct Shamsi due date.
4.  Accurate date-based filtering and analysis in the "AI Analysis & Reporting Center."

**Please ensure your implementation covers:**

*   **Robust Parsing:** Ability to understand various common ways Shamsi dates and relative timeframes ("دو هفته دیگر," "آخر ماه") might be expressed in Persian.
*   **Accurate Conversion:** Flawless conversion between Shamsi and Gregorian calendars if necessary for backend storage or interaction with external systems, while always presenting Shamsi dates to the user.
*   **Timezone Handling:** Explicit handling of Tehran Standard Time (TST) for all scheduled events and reminders.
*   **System-Wide Consistency:** Apply this perfected Shamsi date handling to *all* modules where dates are inputted, processed, displayed, or used for scheduling (CRM tasks, AI-extracted follow-ups, date filters in reports, etc.).

I have full confidence in your ability to achieve this next level of precision. Please outline your specific plan for rolling out this comprehensive Shamsi calendar integration and ensuring its absolute accuracy across the platform. Let me know if any further clarification on date formatting or specific use cases is needed.
