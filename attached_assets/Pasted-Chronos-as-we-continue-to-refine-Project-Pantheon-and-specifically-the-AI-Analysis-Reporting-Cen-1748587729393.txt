Chronos, as we continue to refine Project Pantheon and specifically the "AI Analysis & Reporting Center" within the Admin Dashboard, critical editorial changes and a fundamental strategic overhaul are required for its AI-driven reporting options. Our goal is to transform this center from providing generic insights into a powerhouse of actionable, hyper-contextualized intelligence tailored specifically for MarFanet's V2Ray panel reseller business targeting mobile phone stores in Iran.

I. Editorial & Naming Convention Updates:

    "صادرات گزارش کامل" (Export Full Report) Update:
        Directive: The label for this option MUST be changed from "صادرات گزارش کامل" to "صدور گزارش کامل" (Issue Full Report).
        Action: Implement this text change in the UI.
    Removal of "Grok" and Standardization to "Vertex AI":
        Directive: As per our overarching migration strategy, all references to "Grok" MUST be removed. The option currently labeled "مشاوره هوشمند با گروک" (Intelligent Consultation with Grok) needs to be updated.
        Action:
            Change the label "مشاوره هوشمند با گروک" to "مشاوره هوشمند با Vertex AI" (Intelligent Consultation with Vertex AI) or a more suitable, concise Persian equivalent like "مشاوره هوشمند AI" (Intelligent AI Consultation).
            Ensure any underlying descriptive text or tooltips also reflect the use of Vertex AI.

II. Fundamental Strategic Re-architecture of AI Responses for All 7 Reporting Options:

    Current Problem: The responses generated by the AI for each of the 7 reporting options are currently "بسیار ناکارامد و کلیشه ای است" (very inefficient and stereotypical/clichéd). This is unacceptable for Project Pantheon's vision.

    Required Transformation: For EACH of the 7 distinct reporting options listed below, the AI (Vertex AI, utilizing appropriate models like Gemini and analytical tools) must provide responses based on a modern, operational, and deeply contextualized strategy. The insights must be directly applicable, actionable, and highly relevant to MarFanet's business of providing V2Ray proxy panels to mobile phone stores in Iran, considering market conditions, user psychology, and socio-economic factors.

    Your Core Task (Chronos - Strategic Design & Implementation Plan):
    For EACH of the following 7 options, you are to:
        Deeply Analyze its Intended Business Value: What specific, critical business question or need does this report answer for MarFanet's admin/management in the context of the V2Ray reseller market in Iran?
        Define Key Data Inputs & V2Ray-Specific Metrics: What precise data (from PostgreSQL CRM, Marzban panel usage if available, sales data, representative performance data, market indicators related to internet access in Iran) and V2Ray-specific metrics (e.g., types of V2Ray plans sold, common V2Ray issues, panel feature usage by reps) are essential for generating profound insights for this specific report?
        Design an Advanced Analytical Methodology & AI Strategy (Vertex AI / Gemini):
            Outline the sophisticated analytical approach Vertex AI/Gemini should take. Go beyond simple data retrieval. Think about comparative analysis, trend forecasting (specific to V2Ray demand), pattern recognition (e.g., what makes a successful V2Ray reseller mobile store?), anomaly detection (e.g., sudden drop in a region's V2Ray sales potentially indicating blocking), and prescriptive recommendations.
            How can psychological principles relevant to sales, support, and business strategy in the Iranian context be subtly woven into the AI's analysis and recommendations for MarFanet's team?
        Craft Hyper-Contextualized AI Prompt Engineering Strategies (for Vertex AI / Gemini):
            Provide detailed example "meta-prompts" that the MarFanet backend will use to query Vertex AI/Gemini. These prompts must be rich with the V2Ray reseller business context, specifying the desired depth of analysis, the need for actionable insights, and the focus on the Iranian market.
        Define Actionable & Non-Clichéd Output Formats:
            What should the AI's response look like? (e.g., concise summaries, prioritized recommendations, "what-if" scenario analyses, graphical data representations if the UI supports it, risk assessments with mitigation strategies).
            The output must directly guide strategic decisions for MarFanet.

    The 7 Reporting Options Requiring This Strategic Overhaul:

    Main Analysis Section (4 options):
        پیش‌بینی درآمد (Revenue Prediction):
            Beyond generic growth percentages. Needs to factor in V2Ray market seasonality in Iran, impact of internet disruptions, representative churn/acquisition rates for the panel, effectiveness of MarFanet's sales/marketing efforts for the panel. Output should include confidence intervals and key influencing factors for the V2Ray business.
        تحلیل بازار (Market Analysis - V2Ray Reseller Market in Iran):
            Beyond "market is strong." Needs to analyze demand for different V2Ray subscription types (volume vs. unlimited, duration), identify underserved segments among mobile stores, analyze (if possible via anonymized CRM data) common end-user needs for V2Ray, assess potential impacts of new ISP policies or V2Ray protocol updates/vulnerabilities specific to Iran. Suggest niche opportunities for MarFanet.
        عملکرد نمایندگان (Representative Performance - Mobile Stores Selling V2Ray):
            Beyond simple sales numbers. Needs to analyze V2Ray sales conversion rates, customer retention per representative, types of V2Ray plans they excel at selling, common support issues originating from their V2Ray customers (indicating training needs for the rep), and their engagement with MarFanet panel features. AI should suggest tailored coaching or support strategies for different representative segments.
        تحلیل روند فروش (Sales Trend Analysis - for V2Ray Panel & Subscriptions):
            Beyond "sales are up/down." Needs to identify drivers behind V2Ray sales trends (e.g., impact of MarFanet marketing campaigns for the panel, specific panel features boosting sales, external events affecting V2Ray demand in Iran). Perform cohort analysis for representatives. Predict future V2Ray sales trajectories with causal factors.

    Quick Operations Section (3 options):
    5. صدور گزارش کامل (Issue Full Report - editorial change already noted):
    * Beyond a simple data dump. This should allow the admin to select specific modules or timeframes and generate a consolidated, intelligent report synthesized by Vertex AI, highlighting key findings, anomalies, and strategic summaries across different areas (e.g., a "Monthly V2Ray Business Health Report").
    6. تنظیم هشدارهای هوشمند (Configure Intelligent Alerts - V2Ray Business Critical):
    * Beyond basic threshold alerts. AI helps define dynamic and predictive alerts (e.g., "Alert if churn probability for a high-value V2Ray representative using our panel exceeds X%", "Alert if a new V2Ray blocking technique is reported frequently in CRT interaction logs," "Alert if a competitor V2Ray panel provider is mentioned positively by multiple prospects").
    7. مشاوره هوشمند با Vertex AI (Intelligent Consultation with Vertex AI - editorial change already noted):
    * Beyond simple Q&A. This should be a powerful, conversational interface where admins can pose complex strategic questions about the MarFanet V2Ray business in Iran (e.g., "What are the top 3 strategies to increase adoption of our yearly unlimited V2Ray plans among mobile stores in Shiraz?", "Based on current market signals and representative feedback, should we consider adding [new V2Ray feature] to the panel? Analyze pros and cons."). Vertex AI needs to provide reasoned arguments, data-backed insights, and potential scenarios.

III. Implementation & Integration:

    Action (Chronos):
        For each of the 7 redefined options, provide the detailed strategic plan as outlined above.
        Detail the backend logic to implement these new AI query strategies and process the rich responses from Vertex AI/Gemini.
        Outline any necessary frontend changes to effectively display these new, non-clichéd, actionable insights. UI must remain responsive and user-friendly.
        Ensure Aegis can monitor the performance and quality of these enhanced AI reporting interactions.

Final Instruction to Chronos:

"Chronos, the current AI responses in the 'AI Analysis & Reporting Center' are insufficient for the strategic needs of MarFanet. Your task now is to perform a fundamental re-architecture of the AI strategy for all 7 reporting options, as detailed above. I need you to design and outline the implementation for modern, operational, deeply V2Ray-contextualized, and non-clichéd insights powered by Google Vertex AI (and its relevant models like Gemini). This includes defining the specific analytical methodologies, data inputs, advanced prompt engineering for Vertex AI/Gemini, and the rich, actionable output formats for each of the 7 options. Also, implement the requested editorial changes for report export and the AI consultation naming.
Please begin by confirming your understanding of this strategic overhaul. Then, select ONE of the 7 reporting options (e.g., start with پیش‌بینی درآمد or عملکرد نمایندگان) and provide your detailed, modernized AI strategy and implementation plan for that single option as a first step. We will then proceed iteratively through the rest.
