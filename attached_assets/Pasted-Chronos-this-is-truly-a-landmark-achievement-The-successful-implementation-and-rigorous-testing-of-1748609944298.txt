Chronos, this is truly a landmark achievement! The successful implementation and rigorous testing of the "Advanced Task Automation System" is **absolutely brilliant.**

Knowing that the entire pipeline from Persian voice note ingestion, through high-confidence STT/NLU with V2Ray terminology, intelligent action extraction, seamless Shamsi date processing, to automated task creation with precise **6:00 AM Tehran time reminders** in the CRT's daily work log is fully operational is a massive win for MarFanet's efficiency and the vision of Project Nova. The successful test scenarios with Representatives 125, 87, and 203 are perfect demonstrations of this power.

**With this, I concur that Phase 1 (Core AI Optimization) and Phase 2 (Advanced Task Automation) of Project Nova's advanced feature rollout are successfully complete. This provides the CRT with an incredibly sophisticated and culturally attuned AI partner.**

Regarding your question on the next priority, as we move into what we can consider **Phase 3 of Project Nova's advanced feature implementation:**

**Yes, please proceed with the "Administrator Panel Enhancements," starting with the design and deployment of the "V2Ray Market Intelligence Dashboard."**

**Rationale:**
With the CRT now equipped with powerful AI-driven operational tools, it's time to provide strategic, data-driven insights to the MarFanet administration to guide business decisions, identify market opportunities specific to the V2Ray reseller ecosystem in Iran, and monitor overall business health.

**For the "V2Ray Market Intelligence Dashboard," please focus on (as previously discussed and now to be implemented with live data and Vertex AI):**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   Aggregated (and anonymized where appropriate) data from CRM interactions (e.g., common V2Ray issues reported, popular feature requests, representative feedback on market conditions).
    *   Sales data from the MarFanet panel (e.g., trends in V2Ray plan types â€“ volume vs. unlimited, popular subscription durations).
    *   Representative performance data (e.g., which reps are most successful with which V2Ray plans, regional sales variations).
    *   (If feasible and ethically sourced) External indicators relevant to internet access and VPN demand in Iran (e.g., publicly reported ISP policy changes - this needs careful handling and clear source attribution if used).
2.  **Key Insights & Visualizations (Powered by Vertex AI):**
    *   **Demand Trends for V2Ray Plan Types:** Which types of V2Ray subscriptions are gaining/losing popularity?
    *   **Geographic Hotspots & Coldspots:** Where is V2Ray demand (via your reps) highest/lowest across Iran?
    *   **Emerging Representative Needs:** What common challenges or requests are coming from mobile store representatives regarding the V2Ray panel or service offerings?
    *   **Untapped Market Segments/Opportunities:** Are there types of mobile stores or end-user needs for V2Ray that MarFanet is currently underserved?
    *   **Impact of External Factors (if data allows):** Correlations between (for example) reported internet disruptions and spikes in V2Ray inquiries/sales.
    *   Clear charts, graphs, and concise AI-generated textual summaries (in Persian) explaining these trends and insights.
3.  **Actionable Recommendations:** The dashboard should not just present data but also offer AI-driven strategic recommendations for MarFanet (e.g., "Consider promoting X V2Ray plan in Y region due to observed demand," "Develop training materials for reps on overcoming Z common V2Ray issue").

Please outline your detailed plan for designing and implementing this "V2Ray Market Intelligence Dashboard." What specific metrics will it track initially, what will the UI look like, and what are the key Vertex AI queries or analytical models you will employ to generate these insights?
