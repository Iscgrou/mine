Chronos, this is **truly exceptional and groundbreaking work!** The successful implementation and validation of the "Proactive Relationship Intelligence System" with such detailed behavioral analysis and predictive capabilities for individual representatives is a monumental step in realizing Project Nova's potential.

The specific insights for Representatives 125 (آقای احمدی), 87 (جناب حسینی), and 203 (آقای کریمی) perfectly illustrate the power of this system to provide deep, actionable intelligence. The integration with the Cultural Communication Hub and Psyche-Insights Engine, all informed by V2Ray business context and the perfected Shamsi calendar, is exactly what we envisioned.

**You have successfully completed what we can consider Phase 1 of Project Nova's advanced AI features – with Persian language optimization, Shamsi calendar integration, the Cultural Psychology-Aware Communication Hub, and Proactive Relationship Intelligence all operational. This is a fantastic foundation!**

Regarding your question on the next priority:

**Yes, absolutely. Please proceed immediately with implementing the "Advanced Task Automation" system.**

**Objective:** To fully automate the pipeline from a CRT member's Persian voice note, through AI processing, to a precisely scheduled task with a **6:00 AM Tehran time reminder** appearing in their "Daily Work Log" (کارتابل روزانه).

**This involves finalizing and robustly connecting the following (many parts of which are already well-developed):**

1.  **Voice Note Ingestion:** (Already in place).
2.  **Perfected Persian STT & NLU (Vertex AI):**
    *   Accurate transcription of the voice note, especially V2Ray technical terms and colloquial Persian.
    *   Intelligent extraction of:
        *   Key summary points for the interaction log (maintaining "امانت داری").
        *   **Explicit or implicit action items.**
        *   **Shamsi dates or relative timeframes for follow-up** (e.g., "با ایشان ۱۵ فروردین تماس بگیر", "دو هفته دیگر پیگیری شود").
3.  **Task Creation Logic:**
    *   Automatically create a new task in the CRM's Task Management System.
    *   Populate the task with:
        *   Link to the representative.
        *   Link to the original interaction/voice note.
        *   AI-generated summary (or key action item) as the task description.
        *   **Due Date:** Calculated based on the extracted Shamsi date/timeframe.
        *   **Reminder Time:** Explicitly set to trigger at **6:00 AM Tehran Standard Time** on the due date.
4.  **"Daily Work Log" Integration:**
    *   Ensure these automatically created tasks, with their 6:00 AM TST reminders, appear correctly in the CRT agent's daily dashboard/work log.
5.  **End-to-End Robustness & Error Handling:** Ensure the entire pipeline is resilient, with proper error logging by Aegis if any step (STT, NLU, task creation, scheduling) fails.

This "Advanced Task Automation" will be a massive efficiency booster for the CRT and will fully leverage the excellent AI capabilities you've already built for language understanding and scheduling.

Please outline your final implementation plan for this end-to-end task automation pipeline. I am eager to see this crucial workflow fully operational.
