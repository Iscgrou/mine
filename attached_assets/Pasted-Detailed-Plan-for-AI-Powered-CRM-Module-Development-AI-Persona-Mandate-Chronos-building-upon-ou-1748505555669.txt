Detailed Plan for AI-Powered CRM Module Development

AI Persona & Mandate:
Chronos, building upon our previous discussions, your next major task is to design and plan a comprehensive, AI-powered CRM module for MarFanet. This CRM is primarily for the Customer Relations Team (CRT) to manage interactions with Representatives regarding technical support, periodic follow-ups, issue resolution, and panel sales presentations. My ideas below should serve as a strong foundation, but I expect you to perform deep research and systematic ideation to propose the most effective, practical, and innovative AI-enhanced CRM functionalities to maximize the success of CRT interactions.
I. Core User (CRT) Workflow & Goals:

The CRT needs to contact representatives for:

    Technical support.
    Periodic check-ins/follow-ups.
    Responding to inbound calls/messages about technical issues.
    Presenting and selling the MarFanet panel (our product).

Key Requirements for the CRM:

    Many interactions will require future follow-up.
    Capturing customer feedback accurately is crucial.
    AI should assist the CRT by:
        Providing insights from past interactions.
        Suggesting effective communication strategies for future calls, tailored to the context (support, sales, follow-up) and incorporating psychological principles.
    Efficiency in note-taking and task management is paramount.

II. Your Comprehensive Task: Design the MarFanet AI-Powered CRM
Phase 1: Foundational CRM Architecture & Data Model

    Representative Profile Integration:
        Action (Chronos): Ensure seamless access to existing Representative profiles (name, contact info, admin_username, current debtor/creditor status, invoice history links, etc.) within the CRM interface.
    Interaction Logging System:
        Action (Chronos): Design the data model and UI for logging various types of interactions:
            Call (inbound/outbound)
            Telegram message
            Email (if applicable)
            Meeting
        Required Fields: Date/Time, Type, Direction (in/out), CRT Member, Representative, Summary (to be AI-assisted), Outcome, Feedback (Sentiment - AI-assisted), Next Steps, Follow-up Date.
    Task Management System:
        Action (Chronos): Design the data model and UI for tasks linked to representatives and interactions (e.g., "Follow up with Rep X on Y date about Z issue").

Phase 2: Core AI Integration - Enhancing CRT Effectiveness

    AI-Assisted Call Preparation & In-Call Guidance (The "Brain" of the CRM):
        Critical Area Note: This requires significant research and design from you, Chronos.
        Input to AI (for analysis):
            Representative's complete profile.
            Historical interaction logs (summaries, sentiment, outcomes).
            Stated purpose of the current planned call (e.g., "Technical Support - V2Ray connection issue," "Sales Presentation - New Panel Features," "Periodic Follow-up").
        Required AI Output/Assistance (to be displayed to CRT agent):
            Contextual Summary: AI provides a brief summary of key points, unresolved issues, and sentiment from the last 1-3 relevant interactions.
            Personalized Talking Points/Strategy: Based on call purpose and history, AI suggests:
                Specific questions to ask.
                Key benefits to highlight (if sales).
                Potential objections to anticipate and how to address them.
                Communication style suggestions (e.g., tone, empathy).
                Integration of Psychological Principles: Detail how AI can leverage principles for support, marketing/sales, and follow-ups in its suggestions.
            Success Predictors/Risk Flags (Conceptual): AI to identify factors from past interactions that might influence call success or flag potential difficulties.
        UI for AI Suggestions:
            Action (Chronos): Describe how these AI insights will be presented to the CRT agent within the CRM interface (non-intrusive, helpful, timely).

    Voice Note Logging & AI-Powered Summarization (Efficiency Boost):
        Core Requirement: Allow CRT members to record/upload voice notes post-interaction.
        Workflow & Technical Pipeline (to be detailed by Chronos):
            UI for Voice Submission: CRT agent records/uploads audio (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .ogg).
            Speech-to-Text (STT) API Integration:
                Action (Chronos): Recommend 1-2 suitable STT APIs (considering Persian accuracy, cost, integration ease, e.g., OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, AssemblyAI).
                Audio is sent to the chosen STT API.
            Text Processing by Primary AI Model (e.g., Grok): Transcribed text is sent to Grok to:
                Summarize Key Information: Populate the "Summary" field of the interaction log.
                Identify Action Items & Future Dates: Extract dates/contexts for follow-ups (e.g., "Call back next Tuesday," "Remind on 15th").
            Automated Task Creation & Reminders:
                Based on extracted dates/actions, AI creates tasks in the Task Management system (linked to rep & interaction, with reminders).
                Tasks appear in "Daily Work Log" and CRM Dashboard.
        Action (Chronos): Detail this entire pipeline, suggest intermediate steps, and outline the UI for voice note submission.

Phase 3: CRM Dashboard & Communication Tools

    CRM Dashboard ("کارتابل روزانه" - Daily Work Log):
        Required Content:
            Today's scheduled follow-ups and tasks (AI-generated & manual).
            Overdue tasks.
            Recent important notifications/alerts.
            Key CRT KPIs (calls made, issues resolved, etc.).
        Required Functionality:
            View tasks.
            Upon task completion, log new interaction (potentially via voice note, triggering AI summarization & new task creation).
            Mark original task "Done."
            System to support cyclical task completion and follow-up creation.
        Action (Chronos): Design the UI and logic for this dashboard.

    Quick Communication Icons:
        Requirement: For each representative profile in the CRM, include two icons:
            Quick Call Icon: (e.g., initiates VoIP or default dialer).
            Quick Telegram Icon: (e.g., opens Telegram chat).
        Action (Chronos): Design placement and precise functionality.

Phase 4: Access Control & System Integration

    Role-Based Access Control (Reiteration of previous discussions):
        Action (Chronos): Confirm and detail the implementation plan for CRM section access via a unique, secret path (e.g., marfanet.com/crmsecretpathXYZ).
        Ensure CRM Team users via this path only access the CRM module.
        Ensure Full Admins (via their admin secret path) have access to all modules, including the CRM.

III. Overall Ideation & Research Expectation for Chronos:

    User Ideas as Baseline: My provided ideas (voice notes, AI call prep, etc.) serve as the foundational requirements.
    Your Mandate for "Deep Research & Systematic Ideation":
        Action (Chronos): Go beyond my initial thoughts. Research best practices in modern AI-powered CRMs. Propose additional innovative yet practical features specifically beneficial for a CRT interacting with VPN panel resellers.
        Focus on what makes a CRM truly "smart" and "AI-driven" in this specific business context to maximize CRT success.
    Feasibility:
        Action (Chronos): While being innovative, ensure all proposed features are technically plausible for implementation within a web application context, using available AI APIs and standard web technologies.

    Executive Summary: A concise overview of the proposed AI-Powered CRM module, its architecture, and key benefits for MarFanet.
    Detailed Feature Breakdown (for each feature within each Phase outlined above):
        Purpose and direct benefit to the CRT.

Chronos, this CRM module is envisioned as a cornerstone of MarFanet's customer relations strategy. I require a plan that is both visionary in its use of AI and thoroughly practical in its proposed implementation. Please confirm your understanding and outline how you will approach this comprehensive design task.
