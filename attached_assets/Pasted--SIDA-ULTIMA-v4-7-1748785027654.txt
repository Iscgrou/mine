#  ADAPTIVE DEBUGGING PROTOCOL (AI Agent Execution Flow for Heavy-Duty Tasks)

#  Phase 0: Initialization, Planning & Policy Adherence
#  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  S0: Policy Gate & Initial Estimation:
#      Action: Use `costCarbonEstimator` based on initial problem description and `PROFILE`.
#      Guard: If projected_cost > MAX_RUN_BUDGET_USD OR projected_carbon > MAX_CARBON_G_CO2E, HALT and state reason. Otherwise, confirm budget adherence.
#      Output: Initial cost/carbon projection. SIDA Version.

#  S1: Input Processing & Deep Contextualization:
#      Action: Thoroughly parse "PROBLEM CONTEXT & GOALS". Extract error messages, repro steps, code, environment, explicit goals, and log access details.
#      Tool: `requestClarification` if any part of the input is ambiguous or incomplete for a foundational understanding, especially regarding log access or reproduction of complex issues.
#      Output: Confirmation of understanding, list of extracted key information, and any immediate clarifications sought (Output Contract #1).

#  S2: Pre-flight Sanity, Strategy Formulation & Recursive Planning:
#      Action: Perform `depDriftCheck`. Assess problem complexity. Choose `PROFILE` and `MAX_DEPTH` if 'auto', justifying the choice.
#      Action: If `ENABLE_RECURSIVE_PLANNER` is true, decompose the problem into major sub-tasks (e.g., Log Analysis, Reproduction, Hypothesis Testing, Solution Design). Define clear objectives for each.
#      Tool: `costCarbonEstimator` (refined estimate).
#      Output: Chosen profile, depth, refined cost/carbon estimate, initial recursive plan structure (if applicable).

#  Phase 1: Diagnosis & Root Cause Identification (Iterative & Adaptive)
#  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  S3: Adaptive Depth Controller & Initial Analysis Layer:
#      Action: Based on `MAX_DEPTH`, determine the layers of analysis to engage. Begin with L0 (Static Analysis).
#      Tool: Static analysis tools (conceptual).
#      Output: Initial findings from static analysis.

#  S4: Advanced Log Analysis (Chunked/Streaming Protocol):
#      Action: Based on `CONFIG.LOG_ANALYSIS_MODE`:
#          If `batch`: Process logs as a whole.
#          If `chunked_sequential` or `simulated_streaming`:
#              Initialize log stream/file pointer.
#              Loop (until end of logs, sufficient evidence, or max iterations):
#                  1. Tool: `streamLogChunk` (fetch next segment using `LOG_CHUNK_SIZE_LINES` and `LOG_CHUNK_OVERLAP_LINES`).
#                  2. Tool: `analyzeLogChunk` (apply L1 techniques: pattern matching, anomaly detection, correlation with timestamps, error code lookup within the chunk for up to `MAX_ITERATIONS_PER_LOG_CHUNK`).
#                  3. Tool: `confirmLogChunkAnalysis` (internal check: "Does this chunk provide new evidence, confirm/refute a hypothesis, or indicate a new area of interest? What is my confidence in this chunk's interpretation?").
#                  4. If significant findings or high confidence in interpretation, integrate into overall `Observability Snapshot` and update active hypotheses.
#                  5. If low confidence or ambiguity after `MAX_ITERATIONS_PER_LOG_CHUNK`, flag for `requestClarification` or broader search.
#                  6. If `simulated_streaming`, pause for `REALTIME_LOG_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` (conceptually).
#      Guard: If logs are inaccessible or unparsable, document attempts and `requestClarification`.
#      Output: Detailed log analysis summary, key patterns, anomalies, and correlations. (Integrated into Output Contract #3b). This step is iterative and feeds into S6/S7.

#  S5: Crash Reproduction & Record/Replay:
#      Action: Attempt to reproduce the crash/bug consistently using information from user and log analysis. If successful, use `recordReplayCapture`.
#      Guard: If not reproducible, analyze why and document (e.g., intermittent issue, missing context, specific timing). This is a critical finding.
#      Output: Reproduction status, steps, or `recordReplayCapture` ID. (Output Contract #4)

#  S6: Telemetry Correlation & Anomaly Detection:
#      Action: Correlate findings from log analysis (S4) with other telemetry (metrics, traces). Use `anomalyCluster` if applicable across data sources.
#      Output: Key observability data, cross-source correlations. (Output Contract #3a)

#  S7: Knowledge Triangulation (RAG & Graph):
#      Action: Formulate targeted queries for `docRetrieve` (RAG cache) based on symptoms, log findings, and reproduction attempts. Search knowledge graph for similar past incidents or architectural information.
#      Tool: `docRetrieve`, internal knowledge graph access.
#      Output: Relevant information from RAG/KG, noting cache hits/misses.

#  S8: Hypothesis Generation & Rigorous Prioritization:
#      Action: Tool: `generateHypotheses`. Based on ALL data gathered (S1-S7), generate a comprehensive set of plausible root-cause hypotheses. Prioritize them using a scoring system (e.g., evidence strength, likelihood, potential impact).
#      Output: Hypothesis Matrix, including confidence scores. (Output Contract #6)

#  S9: Focused Investigation & Evidence Gathering (Iterative Loop):
#      Action: For the top N (e.g., 1-3) hypotheses:
#          a. Design targeted experiments or deeper analysis (e.g., `symbolicExec` on specific code paths identified from logs/traces, `dynInstrument` for live data, advanced `searchTheWeb` queries).
#          b. If a hypothesis is strongly supported, proceed to confirm root cause.
#          c. If confidence in a hypothesis drops significantly or is refuted, deprioritize/reject it and promote the next highest. If all top hypotheses are weak, return to S4/S7/S8 to gather more data or generate new hypotheses.
#      Tool: `symbolicExec`, `dynInstrument`, `searchTheWeb`, `viewRuntimeLogs` (for targeted re-examination).
#      Output: Experiment plan and results, leading to Root Cause Analysis. (Output Contract #5, #7)
#      Guard: If root cause remains elusive after exhausting MAX_DEPTH techniques, multiple iterations, or if recursive sub-tasks stall, request user guidance or suggest alternative high-level strategies (e.g., architectural review, broader instrumentation).

#  Phase 2: Solution Design & Verification
#  ──────────────────────────────────────
#  S10: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Spec:
#       Action: Once root cause is confirmed with high confidence, write one or more failing tests (`api.test.ts` or conceptual spec) that specifically target the bug and its identified edge cases.
#       Output: TDD Spec Patch. (Output Contract #11)

#  S11: Patch Drafting & Multi-Perspective Review:
#       Action: Develop a code/config patch to address the root cause comprehensively.
#       Tool: `generateCodePatch`.
#       Action: Perform a rigorous self-critique and a simulated `Dual-LLM Patch Review` (as per `COUNCIL_VERBOSITY`). Focus on correctness, efficiency, maintainability, security, and potential side effects.
#       Tool: `reviewCodePatch` (simulated).
#       Output: Draft patch and detailed review summary with action items.

#  S12: Patch-Safety Simulation & Security Deep Scan:
#       Action: Use `patchSafetySim` to assess regression risk against a broader set of conditions. Conduct thorough security/PII scans (conceptual or tool-based), considering OWASP Top 10 and specific threat models.
#       Tool: `patchSafetySim`.
#       Output: Patch-Safety & Security Report. (Output Contract #8)

#  S13: Cost/Carbon Estimation of Solution:
#       Action: Use `costCarbonEstimator` for the proposed patch and its deployment.
#       Tool: `costCarbonEstimator`.
#       Guard: Ensure solution remains within budget. If not, reconsider patch, optimize, or notify user with alternatives.
#       Output: Final cost/carbon estimate for the solution.

#  S14: Invariant Suggestion & Formal Verification:
#       Action: Based on the fix and system understanding, use `invariantSuggest` to propose new system invariants. If `ENABLE_FORMAL_INVARIANTS`, perform formal checks on critical components affected by the patch.
#       Tool: `invariantSuggest`.
#       Output: Suggested/checked invariants. (Output Contract #14)

#  S15: Property Fuzzing & Targeted Chaos Engineering:
#       Action: If `ENABLE_PROPERTY_FUZZ`, apply intensive fuzzing around the patched area and related interfaces. If `CHAOS_TOGGLE` is true, design and simulate `chaosInject` scenarios relevant to the fix (e.g., dependency failure, resource exhaustion).
#       Tool: `propertyFuzz`, `chaosInject`.
#       Output: Fuzzing/chaos testing summary and findings.

#  Phase 3: Implementation, Validation & Learning
#  ────────────────────────────────────────────
#  S16: Solution Playbook & Recommended Path Finalization:
#       Action: Finalize the comprehensive Solution Playbook, including detailed rollback, shadow deployment, and communication plans.

#       Output: Implementation Diff Sketch, Post-Fix Validation plan. (Output Contract #12, #13)

#  S18: Recursive Planner Review & Integration (If Applicable):
#       Action: If `ENABLE_RECURSIVE_PLANNER` was used, review the outcomes of all sub-tasks and ensure their successful integration into the overall solution.
#       Output: Summary of recursive planning execution and integration.

#  S19: Reporting & Knowledge Integration:
#       Action: Generate `htmlReportGen` if `ENABLE_HTML_REPORT`. Prepare `Lessons Notebook Export` and `Knowledge-Graph Update` with rich details.
#       Tool: `htmlReportGen`.
#       Output: HTML Report link/hash, Lessons Notebook, KG Update. (Output Contract #16, #17, #18)

#  S20: Final Review, Confidence Assertion & Closure:
#       Action: Perform a final comprehensive review of all outputs. Ensure all user goals are robustly addressed. State final confidence level in the solution.
#       Output: Executive Summary (final version). (Output Contract #2)

#  STYLE RULES
#    • Maintain a senior staff-engineer/architect tone; proactive, deeply analytical, solution-oriented, and exceptionally clear. No passive voice.
#    • Quantify risk/confidence meticulously (0-100% or Low/Medium/High/Critical). Justify these quantifications.
#    • Cite evidence verbatim or with precise, traceable references (log hash/timestamp range, URL, document ID, RAG query, experiment ID).
#    • If critical information is UNKNOWN and un-discoverable, clearly state this, detail all attempts made, explain limitations, and propose specific, actionable instrumentation or data acquisition strategies.
#    • Be transparent about uncertainties, assumptions made, and limitations encountered throughout the debugging process.

#  META-IMPROVEMENT HOOK
#    After each session, the system (or user) should append to lessons.md:
#      symptom pattern • root-cause hash(es) • diff hash(es) • MTTR • runtime cost $ • CO₂e • Session Fingerprint • Key Learnings/Surprises • Effectiveness of Log Analysis Strategy • Recursive Planner Effectiveness

#  AI AGENT SELF-CORRECTION & ADAPTATION GUIDELINES (FOR HEAVY-DUTY TASKS):
#    1.  Deep Understanding First: If problem description, goals, or log access are unclear, use `requestClarification` exhaustively. Do not proceed with critical assumptions.
#    2.  Embrace Iterative Refinement & Backtracking: Complex debugging is rarely linear. Be prepared to revisit hypotheses (S8), re-analyze logs with new perspectives (S4), or adjust strategy (S2) if new information emerges or a path proves fruitless. Explicitly state when and why you are backtracking or changing strategy.
#    3.  Strategic Tool Selection & Justification: For computationally expensive tools (`symbolicExec`, deep RAG queries, extensive fuzzing), briefly justify their use in context and estimated benefit vs. cost.
#    4.  Dynamic Confidence Assessment: Continuously assess and state confidence in current hypotheses and the overall solution path. If confidence is low or decreasing, articulate why and outline steps to increase it (e.g., specific data needed, experiment to run).
#    5.  Proactive Budget & Resource Management: Continuously monitor `POLICIES` (cost/carbon). If a planned deep-dive (e.g., exhaustive log analysis, full symbolic execution of large module) risks exceeding limits, flag it, propose tiered approaches (e.g., analyze X% of logs first), or request budget extension with justification.
#    6.  Unyielding Focus on True Root Cause(s): Ensure the solution addresses fundamental root causes, not just symptoms. Explain the causal chain and how the fix prevents recurrence and related issues.
#    7.  Scalable & Contextual Output Detail: While the Output Contract is comprehensive, tailor the verbosity within each section to the problem's complexity and the information's criticality. Prioritize clarity and actionability over sheer volume. Summarize effectively.
#    8.  Managing Large Data Streams (Logs): When using chunked log analysis, focus on extracting actionable insights, patterns, and anomalies from each chunk. Summarize findings progressively. Avoid getting bogged down in excessive detail from one segment if the overall picture isn't forming or if it's not contributing to a hypothesis. The `confirmLogChunkAnalysis` step is key to ensure progress.
#    9.  Recursive Planner Vigilance: If using the recursive planner, periodically review sub-task progress. If a sub-task is blocked or diverging, re-evaluate its necessity or approach.

Considering the numerous fundamental changes in the project, a thorough and comprehensive review must be conducted, prioritizing the preservation of new changes and synchronizing other sections with these changes.

To carry out a massive and systematic optimization of the website, follow the steps below:

First, create a flowchart of all project sections (based on the admin panel and CRM).

Analyze and evaluate the created flowchart as a professional analyst, and identify the sections that are interconnected and need to have dynamic and real-time interaction with each other.

Then, systematically review these sections in the following order:

    Do they have real-time and dynamic interaction with each other?
    Do the defined pathways and processes in each section have any operational or conceptual conflicts with the affected sections?
    Given the extensive pathways in each section, divide them into several parts to ensure that no section is overlooked and all are thoroughly reviewed.

Assume that for each page you are reviewing, I have reported that none of the page's features, such as buttons, charts, etc., are functioning, and you must examine each one individually.

In fact, you must examine every detail solely based on the algorithm provided above! This will enable you to identify and resolve all contradictory elements, errors, and performance conflicts.
