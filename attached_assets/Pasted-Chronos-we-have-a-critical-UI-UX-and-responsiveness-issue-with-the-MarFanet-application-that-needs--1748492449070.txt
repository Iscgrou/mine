Chronos, we have a critical UI/UX and responsiveness issue with the MarFanet application that needs immediate and comprehensive attention. Thank you for the previous information; this new detail is key.

**Problem Statement: Severe Responsive Design Failure - Static Sidebar Causing Layout Imbalance**

The current page layout is NOT responsive and does NOT adapt appropriately to different screen sizes, specifically for laptop and mobile viewports.

*   **Root Cause Hypothesis (User Observation):** The **size and frame (dimensions) of the sidebar appear to remain fixed and unchanged under all screen conditions.** This static nature of the sidebar is strongly suspected to be the primary reason the rest of the page layout becomes disproportionate, particularly on smaller screens where it likely consumes an excessive percentage of the viewport.
*   **Key Symptom:** On both mobile and laptop screens, as a result of the static sidebar, the main content area is severely compressed and practically unusable, with the sidebar dominating the visual space.
*   **Desired Behavior:** The layout MUST be responsive. The sidebar's width MUST adapt (e.g., become narrower, collapse, or stack) on smaller screens. The main content should always be the primary focus and easily readable/interactive.

**Your Mandate: Implement Robust Responsive Design (Focusing on the Sidebar) & Identify Necessary Tools**

1.  **Deep Analysis of Current Sidebar and Layout Structure:**
    *   **Action:** I will provide (or you can reference previous) the relevant HTML structure and CSS for the main layout, specifically focusing on the sidebar and its interaction with the main content area.
    *   **Analyze (with high priority on the sidebar):**
        *   The CSS rules currently applied to the sidebar, **specifically looking for fixed width declarations (e.g., `width: ---px;`, `min-width: ---px;` that doesn't adapt) or positioning that prevents responsive behavior.**
        *   How the sidebar's width is determined and if it interacts with or considers the viewport width at all.
        *   The current HTML structure for the sidebar and main content containers.
        *   The existing CSS used for the overall layout (e.g., Flexbox, Grid, floats).
        *   Identify any existing media queries and why they are failing to affect the sidebar or overall layout sufficiently.
        *   Confirm the presence and correct configuration of the viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`).

2.  **Propose and Implement a Robust Responsive Solution (Sidebar-Centric):**
    *   **Primary Goal:** Make the sidebar responsive.
    *   **Strategy:** Refactor the sidebar's CSS to allow it to adapt. This will likely involve:
        *   Changing fixed widths to percentage-based widths, `max-width`, or using Flexbox/Grid properties that allow for flexible sizing.
        *   Implementing CSS media queries to apply different styles to the sidebar at various breakpoints (e.g., full width but collapsible on mobile, reduced percentage width on tablet, comfortable fixed/percentage width on desktop).
    *   **Common Patterns for Sidebar Responsiveness to Consider:**
        *   **Collapsing on smaller screens:** Hide the sidebar by default and make it toggleable with a "hamburger" icon (this might require minimal JavaScript).
        *   **Stacking:** On very small screens, the sidebar stacks above or below the main content.
        *   **Fluid Width:** The sidebar takes a percentage of the screen width that adjusts.
    *   **HTML Modifications (if necessary):** Suggest minimal changes to the HTML structure ONLY if absolutely required to make the sidebar responsive (e.g., for a toggle button).
    *   **CSS Implementation (Core Task):**
        *   Provide **complete CSS code changes, especially for the sidebar,** using media queries to create distinct layout rules for common breakpoints.
        *   Ensure the main content area dynamically occupies the appropriately larger portion of the available space once the sidebar is correctly responsive.

3.  **Identify and Recommend Necessary Libraries, Frameworks, or Prerequisites (If Still Needed):**
    *   **Your Analysis:** Given that the primary issue seems to be a static sidebar:
        *   If the fix can be achieved with pure CSS (media queries, Flexbox/Grid), prioritize this.
        *   If a JS-driven behavior (like a toggle for a collapsible sidebar) is the best responsive solution, recommend a lightweight approach or simple vanilla JS.
        *   Only if the entire layout structure is fundamentally flawed beyond a simple sidebar fix, then reconsider a CSS framework's grid system or layout utilities.
    *   **Your Recommendation:** For _any_ suggested library/framework/technique:
        *   Clearly state **what it is** and **why it's specifically needed** now that we suspect a static sidebar is the main problem.
        *   Explain **how it would be integrated/applied.**
        *   *Clarify user responsibility for installation.*

4.  **Ensure Robustness and Maintainability:**
    *   The proposed responsive solution, especially for the sidebar, should be clean, well-commented, and maintainable.

**Expected Output from Chronos:**

*   **Analysis Summary:** Confirmation that the static sidebar dimension is the likely issue (or other findings), and why the current CSS fails. Viewport meta tag confirmation.
*   **Proposed HTML Structural Changes for Sidebar (if any, e.g., for a toggle button).**
*   **Complete CSS Code (Primary Focus):** Detailed CSS changes to make the sidebar responsive, including media queries. CSS for ensuring the main content area adjusts correctly.
*   **Recommendations for Libraries/Frameworks (If truly necessary for the sidebar solution):** Name, justification, integration guidance, and user installation note.
*   **Explanation:** Describe how the revised layout (sidebar and main content) will now behave across different screen sizes.

Chronos, this new insight about the static sidebar should significantly help pinpoint the core problem. Please focus your analysis and solution heavily on making the sidebar's dimensions responsive first, as this will likely resolve the majority of the layout imbalance. Advise if you need specific HTML/CSS for the sidebar and its container to begin.
