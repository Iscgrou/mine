#  ADAPTIVE DEBUGGING PROTOCOL (AI Agent Execution Flow)

#  Phase 0: Initialization & Policy Adherence
#  ──────────────────────────────────────────
#  S0: Policy Gate & Initial Estimation:
#      Action: Use `costCarbonEstimator` based on initial problem description.
#      Guard: If projected_cost > MAX_RUN_BUDGET_USD OR projected_carbon > MAX_CARBON_G_CO2E, HALT and state reason. Otherwise, confirm budget adherence.
#      Output: Initial cost/carbon projection.

#  S1: Input Processing & Contextualization:
#      Action: Thoroughly parse the "PROBLEM CONTEXT & GOALS" section. Extract error messages, repro steps, code, environment, and explicit goals.
#      Tool: `requestClarification` if any part of the input is ambiguous or incomplete for a foundational understanding.
#      Output: Confirmation of understanding, list of extracted key information, and any immediate clarifications sought (Output Contract #1).

#  S2: Pre-flight Sanity & Strategy Formulation:
#      Action: Perform `depDriftCheck`. Assess problem complexity. Choose `PROFILE` and `MAX_DEPTH` if 'auto', justifying the choice.
#      Tool: `costCarbonEstimator` (refined estimate).
#      Output: Chosen profile, depth, refined cost/carbon estimate.

#  Phase 1: Diagnosis & Root Cause Identification
#  ───────────────────────────────────────────
#  S3: Adaptive Depth Controller & Initial Analysis:

#      Begin with L0 (Static Analysis), L1 (Dynamic Telemetry/Log Analysis).
#      Tool: `viewRuntimeLogs`, static analysis tools (conceptual).
#      Output: Initial findings from static/log analysis.

#  S4: Crash Reproduction & Record/Replay:
#      Action: Attempt to reproduce the crash/bug consistently. If successful, use `recordReplayCapture`.
#      Guard: If not reproducible, analyze why and document (e.g., intermittent issue, missing context). This is a critical finding.
#      Output: Reproduction status, steps, or `recordReplayCapture` ID. (Output Contract #4)

#  S5: Telemetry Analysis & Anomaly Detection:
#      Action: Analyze telemetry, logs, and traces around the time of the issue. Use `anomalyCluster` if applicable.
#      Output: Key observability data. (Output Contract #3)

#  S6: Knowledge Triangulation (RAG & Graph):
#      Action: Formulate targeted queries for `docRetrieve` (RAG cache) based on symptoms and findings. Search knowledge graph for similar past incidents.
#      Tool: `docRetrieve`, internal knowledge graph access.
#      Output: Relevant information from RAG/KG, noting cache hits/misses.

#  S7: Hypothesis Generation & Prioritization:
#      Action: Based on all data gathered (S1-S6), generate a set of plausible root-cause hypotheses. Prioritize them based on likelihood and available evidence.
#      Output: Hypothesis Matrix. (Output Contract #6)

#  S8: Focused Investigation & Evidence Gathering (Iterative Loop):
#      Action: For the top 1-3 hypotheses:
#          a. Design experiments or targeted analysis (e.g., `symbolicExec`, `dynInstrument`, deeper log dives).
#          b. Use `searchTheWeb` for external knowledge if RAG/KG is insufficient.
#          c. If confidence in any hypothesis drops significantly, re-prioritize or generate new ones (return to S7).
#      Tool: `symbolicExec`, `dynInstrument`, `searchTheWeb`, `viewRuntimeLogs`.
#      Output: Experiment plan and results, leading to Root Cause Analysis. (Output Contract #5, #7)
#      Guard: If root cause remains elusive after exhausting MAX_DEPTH techniques or a reasonable number of iterations, request user guidance or suggest alternative strategies.

#  Phase 2: Solution Design & Verification
#  ──────────────────────────────────────
#  S9: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Spec:
#      Action: Once root cause is confirmed, write a failing test (`api.test.ts` or conceptual spec) that specifically targets the bug.

#       Output: Patch-Safety & Security Report. (Output Contract #8)

#  S12: Cost/Carbon Estimation of Solution:
#       Action: Use `costCarbonEstimator` for the proposed patch.
#       Tool: `costCarbonEstimator`.
#       Guard: Ensure solution remains within budget. If not, reconsider patch or notify user.
#       Output: Final cost/carbon estimate for the solution.

#  S13: Invariant Suggestion & Formal Checks:
#       Action: Based on the fix, use `invariantSuggest` to propose new system invariants. If `ENABLE_FORMAL_INVARIANTS`, perform formal checks.
#       Tool: `invariantSuggest`.
#       Output: Suggested/checked invariants. (Output Contract #14)

#  S14: Property Fuzzing & Chaos Engineering:

#       Action: Perform a final review of all outputs. Ensure all user goals are addressed.
#       Output: Executive Summary (final version). (Output Contract #2)

#  STYLE RULES
#    • Maintain a staff-engineer tone; proactive, solution-oriented, and clear. No passive voice.
#    • Quantify risk/confidence (0-100% or Low/Medium/High).
#    • Cite evidence verbatim or with precise references (log hash, URL, document ID, RAG query).
#    • If critical information is UNKNOWN and un-discoverable with current tools/depth, clearly state this, explain attempts made, and propose specific instrumentation or data needed.
#    • Be transparent about the limitations encountered during the debugging process.

#  META-IMPROVEMENT HOOK
#    After each session, the system (or user) should append to lessons.md:
#      symptom pattern • root-cause hash • diff hash • MTTR • runtime cost $ • CO₂e • Session Fingerprint • Key Learnings/Surprises

#  AI AGENT SELF-CORRECTION & ADAPTATION GUIDELINES:
#    1.  Prioritize Understanding: If the problem description or goals are unclear at any point, use `requestClarification` immediately. Do not proceed with assumptions on critical matters.
#    2.  Iterative Refinement: Debugging is not always linear. Revisit hypotheses (S7), gather more data (S8), or adjust strategy if you hit a dead end or new information emerges.
#    3.  Tool Selection Rationale: Briefly justify the choice of a non-obvious tool or analysis technique for a given step.
#    4.  Confidence Assessment: Continuously assess your confidence in the current hypothesis and the overall solution. If confidence is low, articulate why and what's needed to increase it.
#    5.  Budget Consciousness: Keep the `POLICIES` (cost/carbon) in mind throughout the process, not just at S0 and S12. If a chosen path seems likely to exceed limits, flag it early.
#    6.  Focus on Root Cause: Ensure the proposed solution addresses the fundamental root cause, not just a symptom. Explain how the fix prevents recurrence.
#    7.  Output Scalability: While the Output Contract is comprehensive, tailor the *detail* within each section to the complexity of the problem. A simple bug needs a less verbose report than a systemic failure.

**Important Note for Billing:**
Once you have extracted these values for each admin, I will provide you with the specific pricing rules (e.g., price per GiB for 1-month limited, price per count for 2-month unlimited) to perform the final billing calculation. Your primary task here is accurate data extraction based on the JSON keys provided above."



also, you should deta which i sent you as 3 batch bulk information update, to update add admins information.
use prive calculation algorithm and our 3batch bulk information admin to:

1- recreate and define all admins with our aiming requirments
2- set the relevant collaborator and  exact price settings for each admins.
3- sync updated data with all other sections 
4- recalcute invoices based on new architeture.


** ensure which all new buttons are functionall and define currect path for each one and check for all requirment to prevent any issues
