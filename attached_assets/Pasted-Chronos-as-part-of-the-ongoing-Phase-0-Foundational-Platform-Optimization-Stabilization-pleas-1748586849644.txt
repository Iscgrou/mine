Chronos, as part of the ongoing "Phase 0: Foundational Platform Optimization & Stabilization," please address the following critical corrections related to invoice generation and the "Billing Management" (صورتحساب‌ها) section:

1. Invoice Currency Standardization:

    Directive: All invoices generated by the MarFanet system MUST use "Toman" (تومان) as the sole currency unit.
    Action:
        Review all invoice generation logic, calculation modules, and display templates (for both PDF and image outputs, as well as any on-screen previews).
        Ensure that all monetary values are explicitly calculated, stored (if applicable with currency markers), and displayed with the "Toman" currency indicator. For example: "۵۰۰,۰۰۰ تومان".
        Verify that any currency symbols or formatting are consistently applied for Toman.

2. Correction of Representative Display in "Billing Management" (صورتحساب‌ها) Section:

    Context: In the "Billing Management" section, where each representative has a rectangular box/row displaying their invoice information.
    Current Problem: The field intended to display the "Representative" name is incorrectly showing a concatenated list of their customers' usernames (the end-users of the V2Ray subscriptions) instead of the Representative's own unique identifier.
        Example of current incorrect display:
        Invoice: INV-2025-847149
        Representative: Tahamobile06,Tahamobile11,Tahamobile123,Tahamobile13,Tahamobile15,Tahamobile45,Tahamobileaghayeyousefii,Tahamobileahangar,Tahamobilemelat10,Tahamobilenalchi,Tahamobilesaeed
    Required Correction:
        The "Representative" field in each invoice row within the "Billing Management" section MUST display ONLY the unique admin_username of the Representative.
        This admin_username is the identifier extracted from Column A (the first column) of the imported .ods file.
        The names/usernames of the Representative's customers (which are from Column B, the second column of the .ods file, or generated by the panel for those customers) should NOT be displayed in this "Representative" field in the main invoice list view.
        (As previously discussed, the list of a representative's customers for a given invoice period should appear in a dedicated section within the individual invoice document itself, titled "مشخصات مشتری های ایجاد شده" - Details of Created Customers, not in this overview list).
    Action (Chronos):
        Review the backend logic and frontend components responsible for populating and displaying the "Billing Management" list.
        Modify the data retrieval and display logic to ensure that only the Representative's admin_username (from Column A of the .ods file) is shown in the "Representative" field for each invoice entry in this list.
        Confirm that the data source for this field correctly references the representative's primary identifier and not the list of their end-customer usernames.

Please confirm these directives are integrated into your Phase 0 optimization plan, specifically under "Full Functional Integrity Verification" and "UI/UX Polish." These corrections are vital for data accuracy and user clarity in our billing system.
