Implement True Dynamic Page Layout Responsiveness to Sidebar State Changes (System-Wide)

Chronos, I have identified a fundamental issue underlying many of the persistent layout and alignment problems we've been experiencing across both Admin and CRM panels:

Core Problem: Page Layouts Are Not Dynamically Responsive to Sidebar State (Open/Closed)

    Observation: It appears the main content area layouts for both Admin and CRM panels are designed and calculated based on the sidebar being permanently open.
    Symptom: When the sidebar is closed or collapsed, the main content area does not dynamically resize or readjust its layout to utilize the newly available horizontal space. This results in:
        Content remaining squashed to one side (often the original position as if the sidebar were still there).
        Excessive empty space where the sidebar used to be.
        A general look of imbalance and improper space utilization.
    This is a system-wide architectural issue affecting responsiveness and visual appeal on all screen sizes when the sidebar state changes.

Your Absolute Mandate: Implement a Truly Dynamic and Adaptive Layout System for All Project Pantheon Panels.

The main page layouts (containing the primary content for Admin and CRM sections) MUST dynamically and instantaneously respond to any change in the sidebar's visibility or width.

I. Comprehensive Plan Development (Chronos to Outline First):

Before implementing any code, you must first present a comprehensive plan detailing how you will achieve this true dynamic layout responsiveness. This plan should include:

    State Detection/Communication:
        How will the main content layout component(s) be reliably informed of the sidebar's current state (open, closed, or its current width if it's a resizable sidebar)? (e.g., via a global state management solution like Redux/Zustand/Context API, event emitters, props passed down from a parent layout component that manages the sidebar).
    CSS Strategy for Dynamic Layouts:
        What CSS techniques will you employ to allow the main content area to expand and contract smoothly? (e.g.,
            Using CSS Grid with fr units for the main content and sidebar columns, where the sidebar column can effectively become 0fr or have its grid-template-columns definition change.
            Using Flexbox where the main content item has flex-grow: 1.
            Applying/removing specific CSS classes to the main content wrapper based on sidebar state, which then trigger different layout rules.
            CSS Custom Properties (Variables) that change based on sidebar state.
        How will you ensure smooth transitions or animations (if desired) when the layout readjusts?
    JavaScript Logic (if necessary):
        What JavaScript (if any) will be needed to manage the state, apply classes, or manually trigger layout recalculations (though pure CSS solutions are often preferred for performance if feasible)?
    Impact Assessment & Testing Strategy:
        How will you ensure this change doesn't negatively impact existing responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? The layout must still be perfectly responsive within its current available width, whether the sidebar is open or closed.
        Outline how you will test this across various components (tables, dashboards, forms) and screen sizes, specifically toggling the sidebar open and closed.

II. Implementation Across All Panels & Sections:

    Action (Chronos - After Plan Approval):
        Implement the approved dynamic layout strategy consistently across:
            The Admin Panel (all pages and sections).
            The CRM Panel (all pages and sections).
        Ensure that ALL elements within the main content area (tables, cards, text blocks, dashboards, AI reporting center views) correctly reflow and utilize the available space whether the sidebar is open or closed.
        The goal is a seamless, fluid experience where the content intelligently adapts to the actual available viewport width not occluded by the sidebar.

III. Verification:

    Action (Chronos): After implementation, provide clear instructions for me to test. I will specifically check:
        Layout behavior on various screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile).
        Layout behavior when the sidebar is toggled open and closed on each of those screen sizes.
        That no content overflows, gets misaligned, or has excessive/awkward empty space due to sidebar state changes.
        That all clickable elements remain functional during and after these layout shifts.

Final Instruction to Chronos:

"Chronos, the lack of dynamic layout adjustment when the sidebar is closed is a fundamental architectural issue impacting the usability and professionalism of both Admin and CRM panels. This needs to be addressed system-wide.

    First, present your comprehensive plan detailing how you will make the main content layouts truly responsive to sidebar state changes (state detection, CSS strategy, JS logic, impact assessment).
    After I approve your plan, proceed with the implementation across all relevant sections of the Admin and CRM panels.
    Ensure this solution is robust and harmonizes with existing responsive design rules for different screen sizes. The layout must be perfect whether the sidebar is open or closed, on any device.

This is a foundational fix. Please provide your strategic plan for implementing this true dynamic layout responsiveness."

Key strengths of this revised prompt:

    Identifies Specific Root Cause: Clearly states the problem is layout not reacting to sidebar state.
    Demands a Plan First: This is crucial for such an architectural change. Chronos needs to outline how it will solve this before jumping into code. This allows you to review its approach.
    Focuses on Dynamic Rules: Uses your term "dynamic rules" and emphasizes that all aspects of the layout need to be considered.
    System-Wide Application: Makes it clear this fix needs to apply to all project layouts.
    Considers Different Techniques: Prompts Chronos to think about various CSS/JS methods.
    Reinforces Overall Responsiveness: Ensures this fix doesn't break existing screen-size responsiveness.
    Clear Verification Step: You will test the outcome.
