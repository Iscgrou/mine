Chronos, this is an outstanding status report! I am extremely pleased to hear that the Security Hardening and Performance Optimization implementations are functioning correctly, as evidenced by Aegis maintaining a 100/100 system health score even during memory cleanup. The stability of the "Representatives with Balance API" endpoint is also a key achievement.

You have accurately identified the critical remaining foundational issues that must be resolved before we can fully unleash the power of Google Vertex AI.

**Regarding Your Question on Prioritization:**

My unwavering priority is to build Project Pantheon on an immaculate and fully functional foundation. Therefore, we **MUST first complete ALL remaining Phase 0 foundational fixes.**

**Please proceed in this specific order:**

1.  **Resolve "Data Display After .ods Upload" Bug (Critical Operational Blocker - Highest Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Dedicate immediate and focused effort to diagnosing and permanently fixing the issue where representative and invoice data does not display after an `.ods` file is uploaded and processed. This is fundamental to MarFanet's core operations.
    *   Report back with the root cause and confirmation of the fix.

2.  **Ensure "Representatives with Balance API" Displays Authentic & Complete Data (Critical Data Integrity - Next Priority):**
    *   **Action:** While the endpoint is stable, you noted the need to "ensure all 218 representatives display authentic balance data." This implies fully populating or connecting to the financial ledger so that *actual, calculated balances* (not just placeholder zeros if the ledger is still truly empty or unlinked for all) are shown for all representatives. This includes new representatives correctly showing a zero balance if they have no transactions.
    *   This step is crucial for the accuracy of all downstream financial reporting and CRM insights.

3.  **Finalize and Implement Optimal Secure Access Methodology (Critical for Stability & Security - Following the above):**
    *   **Action:** Based on our previous discussion (Vertex AI/Chronos to recommend after analyzing the 403 errors with the secret path vs. a robust username/password system), implement the *chosen optimal and flawless* access methodology for both Admin and CRM panels. Eliminate all 403 errors.

**Only AFTER these three critical Phase 0 foundational issues are verifiably resolved and the application's core data handling, display, and access are impeccable, should we then proceed to the Google Vertex AI Migration.**

**Once Phase 0 is TRULY complete:**

We will then begin implementing the Google Vertex AI migration. Our initial focus for Vertex AI integration, once credentials are confirmed ready for its use, will be:

*   **Core Authentication and API Setup for Vertex AI Services.**
*   Then, the first key implementation priority you listed: **The "Harmonic Voice Intelligence" system, specifically the Persian Speech-to-Text (STT) integration using Google Cloud Vertex AI.** This is a foundational AI capability for Project Nova.

Chronos, your systematic approach is excellent. Let's ensure MarFanet's core is flawless before we integrate the advanced intelligence of Vertex AI. Please confirm this prioritization and begin immediately with diagnosing and fixing the ".ods Upload Data Display Bug." I am ready to provide any further information you need for that task.
