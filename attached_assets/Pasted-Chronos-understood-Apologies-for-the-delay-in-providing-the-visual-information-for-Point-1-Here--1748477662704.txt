Chronos, understood! Apologies for the delay in providing the visual information for Point 1.

Here are the details for **Point 1: Overall Dark Theme Harmony**:

**[CHOOSE ONE OPTION BELOW AND DELETE THE OTHER]**

**Option A: Screenshot Provided**
*   **Current State Screenshot for MarFanet App's Overall Theme/Dashboard:**
    *   [**PASTE THE DIRECT LINK TO YOUR SCREENSHOT HERE**]
*   **Brief Description of Current State & Specific Deviation from Target (referencing the screenshot):**
    *   [**ADD 1-3 SENTENCES HIGHLIGHTING THE MAIN ISSUES VISIBLE IN THE SCREENSHOT. Example:** "As you can see in the screenshot, the current main background is a light gray instead of the target deep blue #0A0F1E. The cards for sections are simple white boxes, not the secondary dark blue, and the overall aesthetic feels very generic, lacking the professional tech-focused look."]

**Option B: Detailed Description (Use if no screenshot is possible)**
*   **Detailed Description of Current State & Specific Deviation from Target:**
    *   "Regarding the current MarFanet dashboard's 'Overall Dark Theme Harmony':
        *   The current background is [**DESCRIBE THE COLOR YOU SEE, e.g., 'a flat, medium charcoal gray, approximately #555555,' or 'plain white'**] instead of the target deep blue #0A0F1E.
        *   The cards/sections that should have the secondary dark blue background (like #10182D) are currently [**DESCRIBE THEIR APPEARANCE, e.g., 'the same color as the main background,' or 'a slightly lighter gray, but not blue'**].
        *   The overall feel currently lacks the professional tech-focused aesthetic; it appears [**DESCRIBE THE FEEL, e.g., 'quite basic and unfinished,' or 'more like a standard bootstrap theme than the targeted marfanet.com style'**]. There are no subtle visual cues like soft shadows or the specific color depth we discussed."
