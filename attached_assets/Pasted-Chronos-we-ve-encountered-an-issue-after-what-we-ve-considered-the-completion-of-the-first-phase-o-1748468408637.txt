Chronos, we've encountered an issue after what we've considered the completion of the first phase (or a specific set of modules).

**Issue Identified: "AI Tools" Section Missing from Settings Tab**

**Context:**
According to our "God of Universe" project plan for MarFanet, and specifically referencing:
*   **Module 8: Smart Analytics (AI-Powered using Grok or similar)** – whose functionalities would logically have settings or configuration options.
*   **Module 5: Telegram Integration (Semi-Manual & AI-Powered Reporting)** – which requires a Telegram channel token to be managed, likely within an "AI Tools" or "Integrations" area of the Settings.
*   **Module 10: Settings & Administration** – which is the designated parent area for such configurations.

The "AI Tools" functionalities (or at least the links/placeholders for them, such as Telegram token management, AI analytics configuration, etc.) are **not currently visible or accessible within the 'Settings' tab/section** of the MarFanet application's UI.

**Your Task: Diagnose and Rectify**

As Chronos, the Lead Architect and Developer, please perform the following:

1.  **Review Project Plan & Your Implementation:**
    *   Re-examine the "God of Universe" prompt, specifically the sections detailing "Smart Analytics," "Telegram Integration (AI-Powered Reporting)," and "Settings & Administration."
    *   Review the code you have generated (or analyzed from the `finone` repository if applicable) for the "Settings" module/page.
    *   Review the code you have generated (or planned) for the "AI Tools" functionalities themselves (e.g., where Telegram token input is handled, where analytics configurations might reside).

2.  **Identify the Root Cause(s):** Determine *why* the "AI Tools" section is not appearing in the Settings tab. Possible reasons could include (but are not limited to):
    *   The UI component/link for "AI Tools" was not added to the Settings tab's template/code.
    *   The "AI Tools" module itself has not been fully developed or integrated yet (if so, clarify its current status based on your plan).
    *   There's a conditional rendering issue hiding it (e.g., a permission flag, a feature toggle that's off).
    *   Routing issues: The link might exist, but the route to the AI Tools page/component is not defined or is incorrect.
    *   A simple oversight during development.

3.  **Propose a Solution (with Code):**
    *   Clearly explain the identified root cause(s).
    *   Provide the specific code modifications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Backend, template language) needed to:
        *   Correctly display a link/section for "AI Tools" within the "Settings" tab.
        *   Ensure this link correctly routes to the intended "AI Tools" management interface.
        *   If the "AI Tools" module is partially developed, indicate what's needed to make its settings portion visible.
    *   If the module is not yet developed according to your internal phasing, state this clearly and indicate when it was planned for, and provide placeholder UI code for the settings tab for now.

4.  **Ensure Adherence to Visual Guidelines:** Any new UI elements added to the Settings tab for "AI Tools" must adhere to the MarFanet aesthetic we discussed (inspired by `marfanet.com`).

**Required Output:**

*   **Problem Confirmation:** Acknowledge the issue.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Your findings on why it's missing.
*   **Proposed Solution & Code Snippets:** The exact changes needed.
*   **Impact Assessment (if any):** Will this change affect other modules?
*   **Updated Status (if applicable):** If the AI Tools module was planned for a later phase.

Please investigate this and provide your analysis and solution.
