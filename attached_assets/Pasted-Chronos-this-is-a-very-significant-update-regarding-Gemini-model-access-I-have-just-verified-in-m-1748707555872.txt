Chronos, this is a very significant update regarding Gemini model access.

I have just verified in my Google Cloud Console for Project ID `leafy-display-459909-k9` that **Gemini 2.5 Pro IS listed as available and usable in Vertex AI Studio.** A specific identifier like `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` (or a similar current preview alias for 2.5 Pro) appears to be accessible.

This strongly suggests that our existing Google Cloud Service Account JSON key (with the `Vertex AI User` role for project `leafy-display-459909-k9`) **SHOULD have the necessary permissions** to interact with Gemini 2.5 Pro programmatically, provided the correct model ID and API calls are used.

The previous 404 errors you encountered when trying "gemini-2.5-pro-preview" or "gemini-2.5-pro" might have been due to using a generic or incorrect model ID, or perhaps an API version mismatch for preview models.

**Revised Directive for "Project Genesis Reborn" - Prioritize Gemini 2.5 Pro:**

Given this confirmation:

1.  **Target Gemini 2.5 Pro (Highest Priority Model):**
    *   **Action (Chronos):** Before defaulting to Gemini 1.5 Pro, I need you to make a **renewed and thorough attempt to configure and connect to Gemini 2.5 Pro** using our existing credentials for Project ID `leafy-display-459909-k9`.
    *   **Crucial Steps for You to Take:**
        *   **Identify the Precise Model ID:** Meticulously check the Google Cloud documentation or the Vertex AI Model Garden (as accessible via API or through documentation for programmatic access) for the **exact, currently valid model identifier** for the latest available Gemini 2.5 Pro preview version (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, or whatever the current alias is for programmatic use within our project/region).
        *   **Verify API Endpoint & Version:** Ensure you are using the correct API endpoint and version (e.g., `v1` or a specific `v1betaX` if required for preview models) for calls to Gemini 2.5 Pro.
        *   **Test with a Simple "generateContent" Call:** Using the precise model ID and our existing credentials, attempt a very simple test call to Gemini 2.5 Pro (e.g., "What is 2+2?").
    *   **Report Back Immediately:** Inform me of the outcome of this specific test. Provide the exact model ID you used, the API endpoint, and any error messages verbatim if it still fails.

2.  **Fallback to Gemini 1.5 Pro (Only if 2.5 Pro is Still Inaccessible After Exhaustive Checks):**
    *   If, after these meticulous checks and attempts with precise model identifiers, Gemini 2.5 Pro *still* returns an access error that we cannot immediately resolve (e.g., it genuinely requires a different type of project enrollment we don't have), then, and only then, should you configure your Vertex AI Orchestrator to use `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` for "Project Genesis Reborn."

**Next Steps for Chronos (Based on the outcome of the Gemini 2.5 Pro test):**

*   **If Gemini 2.5 Pro connection is SUCCESSFUL:**
    *   Confirm this success.
    *   Proceed with compiling the **"Complete MarFanet Blueprint & Current State Dossier for Gemini 2.5 Pro,"** ensuring it is exhaustive and ready. Present this dossier to me for final review before you task Gemini 2.5 Pro with its analysis.
*   **If Gemini 2.5 Pro connection STILL FAILS (despite using specific model IDs):**
    *   Report the exact failure details.
    *   Confirm you will then proceed using **`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`** and compile the dossier tailored for that model, as per our previous fallback plan.

The potential to use Gemini 2.5 Pro for "Project Genesis Reborn" is highly desirable due to its advanced capabilities. Let's make every effort to connect to it correctly. Please proceed with this verification of Gemini 2.5 Pro access as your immediate next step.
