Chronos, this is outstanding news! The successful live Grok API integration for call preparation, with excellent performance and high-quality Persian content generation, is a major breakthrough for Project Nova. It's also incredibly reassuring to see Aegis actively monitoring these live AI interactions and database operations with such detailed metrics and even a "System Score."

I understand from your report that while Grok is operational and Aegis is performing well, the **voice processing pipeline is currently encountering service connectivity issues specifically related to the Speech-to-Text (STT) API configuration.**

**My Priority: Let's Verify and Complete the Speech-to-Text (STT) Service Configuration to Enable the Full Voice Processing Pipeline.**

**Rationale:**
1.  A fully operational voice processing pipeline is a cornerstone of Nova's AI capabilities and the "Harmonic Voice Intelligence System."
2.  This will allow Aegis to monitor the complete, end-to-end AI workflow for voice notes, providing comprehensive insights.
3.  Having real transcribed data will be invaluable when we subsequently build the Nova AI dashboard.

**Therefore, please proceed with the following:**

1.  **Verify STT API Configuration:**
    *   You previously requested the STT API key, which I understand has been provided/configured (e.g., as `STT_PERSIAN_API_KEY` or similar).
    *   Please double-check that the backend service attempting to call the STT API is:
        *   Correctly accessing this API key.
        *   Using the correct endpoint URL for the STT service.
        *   Sending the audio data in the format expected by the STT API.
        *   Correctly configured for Persian language processing with the STT provider.
        *   Handling authentication with the STT service correctly.
    *   If you can pinpoint the exact nature of the "service connectivity issue" (e.g., authentication error, wrong endpoint, network issue from the server, incorrect API request format), please detail it.

2.  **Test STT Integration:**
    *   Once you believe the configuration is correct, please attempt to process a sample Persian voice note again.
    *   I want to see Aegis logs (or your direct report) confirming:
        *   A successful connection to the STT service.
        *   An accurate Persian transcription received.
        *   The transcription being passed to the (already working) Grok API for subsequent processing (like sentiment analysis or summarization, as per our plan for the full pipeline).
        *   Successful storage of the transcription and any derived insights in the database.

3.  **Report on Resolution:**
    *   Inform me once the STT service connectivity is resolved and the voice processing pipeline is successfully processing a test audio end-to-end.
    *   At that point, let's also review Aegis's "System Score" and memory usage to see if resolving this connectivity issue has a positive impact.

Once the full voice processing pipeline is demonstrably operational and monitored by Aegis, we will then move with full confidence to implementing the **Nova AI dashboard interface.**

Please proceed with diagnosing and resolving the STT API configuration issue. Let me know if you require me to re-verify any credentials or provide specific network configuration details from our server environment (though hopefully, it's an application-level configuration).
