 Eradicate Old Access Path & Implement AI-Powered CRT Performance Monitoring for Admin

Chronos, as we continue to refine and stabilize the MarFanet platform during "Project Pantheon - Phase Omega R2," two critical items require your immediate and thorough attention: ensuring the complete removal of the old access methodology to resolve persistent 403 errors, and introducing a new AI-powered monitoring section for CRT performance within the Admin panel.

I. Absolute Eradication of Old "Secret Path" Access & Resolution of 403 Errors (Critical Security & Stability):

    Problem Context: Despite our transition to a username/password login system, I am still occasionally encountering 403 Forbidden errors on some browsers when attempting to access the website. This strongly suggests that remnants of the previous "secret path" access method (which involved dropping requests to the main domain and only allowing access via a specific URL suffix) are still present and causing conflicts or incorrect request handling.
    Your Uncompromising Mandate (Chronos):
        Deep Code & Configuration Audit: Conduct an exhaustive search through the entire MarFanet codebase (frontend, backend), server configurations (Nginx, Apache, or any other web server/reverse proxy configurations), routing definitions, and any middleware.
        Identify and COMPLETELY REMOVE ALL TRACES: Locate and meticulously delete every single line of code, configuration rule, or logical artifact associated with the old "secret path" access system and the logic for dropping requests to the base domain.
        Verify New Login System Exclusivity: Ensure that the new username/password system is now the sole and exclusive method for gaining authenticated access to both the Admin and CRM panels.
        Test Across Multiple Browsers: After removal, rigorously test website access (to login page and subsequently to panels after login) on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and in different modes (incognito/private browsing, with and without browser extensions) to confirm that the 403 errors are completely eliminated and access is consistently stable.
        Ensure No Regressions: This complete removal must not negatively impact any other part of the application or the newly implemented username/password system.
    Deliverable: Confirmation that all remnants of the old access system have been expunged, and the 403 errors related to access methodology are fully resolved across all common browsers.

II. New Admin Panel Feature: AI-Powered CRT Performance Monitoring & Insights Dashboard

    Objective: Provide the MarFanet Administrator with a dedicated section in the Admin Panel to monitor and analyze the performance, activities, and effectiveness of the Customer Relations Team (CRT) using AI-driven insights.
    Your Task (Chronos - Design & Plan Implementation, Leveraging Vertex AI):
        A. Define Core Metrics & Data Sources:
            Identify key metrics for CRT performance relevant to MarFanet's V2Ray business (e.g., number of interactions [calls, Telegram], average interaction duration, interaction outcomes [issue resolved, sale made, follow-up scheduled], types of issues handled, sentiment trends from interactions, task completion rates).
            Data will primarily come from the Project Nova CRM database (interaction logs, task management system, AI-generated summaries and sentiment).
        B. Design the "CRT Performance Dashboard" UI within the Admin Panel:
            This dashboard should allow the Admin to view CRT performance daily or over selectable timeframes (using our standardized 1/2/3/4/8 week options and custom Shamsi date ranges).
            Key Information & AI-Driven Insights to Display:
                Overall Activity: Total interactions, calls made, average call duration.
                Interaction Outcomes: Breakdown of interaction results (e.g., successful V2Ray troubleshooting, panel sales presentations delivered, follow-ups scheduled).
                Common Representative Issues/Topics: AI identifies and trends the most frequent issues or topics discussed by CRT with representatives (e.g., "V2Ray connection problems," "Panel feature X query," "Subscription renewal questions").
                General Representative Feedback Sentiment: AI analyzes overall sentiment from CRT interactions to provide a pulse on representative satisfaction or frustration.
                (Conceptual) CRT Member Performance Highlights (Optional & Sensitive - requires careful ethical consideration): If desired, high-level, anonymized (or permissioned) performance indicators per CRT member (e.g., average interactions per day, task completion rate). This needs to be handled very carefully.
                Trends & Anomalies: AI highlights significant changes or anomalies in CRT activity or representative feedback.
        C. Orchestrate Vertex AI (Gemini) for Analysis & Reporting:
            Advanced Prompt Engineering by Chronos for Vertex AI:
                Your primary role here is to design how MarFanet's backend will query Vertex AI (Gemini) to generate these CRT performance insights. You have the initial idea. Now, I need you to use your expertise to further refine and expand upon this concept, and then create the sophisticated prompts for Vertex AI (Gemini) to fully realize it.
                Instruction to Vertex AI (via your prompts): Tell Vertex AI to act as a "CRM Operations Analyst." Provide it with aggregated, anonymized (where appropriate) CRT interaction data for the selected period. Ask it to analyze this data to produce the insights listed above (overall activity, outcomes, common issues, sentiment trends, etc.). The prompts should encourage creative and insightful analysis, not just raw numbers.
                Example Meta-Prompt Snippet for Vertex AI (for Chronos to expand and refine): "You are a CRM Operations Analyst for MarFanet, a V2Ray panel provider for Iranian mobile stores. Based on the following CRT interaction data for the period [Start Date] to [End Date] ([aggregated data: interaction counts, types, durations, AI-derived sentiment scores, topics discussed, task completion stats]), provide a comprehensive report on CRT performance. Identify key trends in representative issues, overall feedback sentiment, CRT activity levels, and provide 2-3 actionable insights for the MarFanet Admin to improve CRT effectiveness or address common representative concerns related to our V2Ray services in Iran."
                Chronos, I expect you to take my initial idea for this CRT monitoring dashboard and, by giving detailed context and requirements to Vertex AI (via your masterfully crafted prompts), have Vertex AI help you co-create and fully flesh out the most effective and insightful version of this feature. Vertex AI should help you design the specific analyses and report structures.
        D. UI Implementation: Ensure the dashboard is responsive, uses clear data visualizations (charts, graphs if appropriate), and presents information in Persian.

III. Integration with Ongoing Work:

    The eradication of the old access method is part of "Pantheon Phase 0: Foundational Website Optimization & Stabilization."
    The new CRT Performance Monitoring Dashboard is a new feature, likely falling under Admin Panel Enhancements after Project Nova's core CRM features are stable. However, the planning and AI prompt design for it can begin now.

Final Instruction to Chronos:

"Chronos, these are two critical directives:

    Absolute Eradication of Old Access Path & 403 Resolution: Your immediate, top priority is to conduct the deep audit and completely remove all remnants of the old 'secret path' access system. Ensure the new username/password system is the sole, flawlessly functioning entry point and that the 403 errors are eliminated across all browsers.
    Design & Plan for AI-Powered CRT Performance Monitoring Dashboard: Concurrently, or immediately after resolving the access issue, begin designing the new Admin panel section for AI-driven CRT performance monitoring. Critically, leverage your ability to orchestrate Vertex AI: feed it the concept of this dashboard along with MarFanet's full business context, and task Vertex AI with helping you (Chronos) design the most effective analyses, metrics, and report structures to make this feature exceptionally insightful and useful. I am giving you the initial idea; I expect you and Vertex AI to collaborate to bring it to its full potential.

Report back first on the complete resolution of the access path/403 error issue. Once that is confirmed stable, present your detailed plan and Vertex AI-enhanced design for the CRT Performance Monitoring Dashboard, including the specific Vertex AI prompts you will use."

Key improvements in this prompt:

    Prioritization within the prompt: Clearly states that fixing the 403/access path issue is top priority.
    Meta-Task for Chronos/Vertex AI: Explicitly tells Chronos to use Vertex AI not just to implement your idea for the CRT dashboard, but to collaborate on and enhance the design of the dashboard itself, including the analyses and prompts. This leverages AI for creative design work.
    Specific Instructions for Eradicating Old System: Details what "complete removal" entails.
    Clear Objectives for CRT Dashboard: Lists the kind of insights you're looking for.
    Reinforces Context: Reminds Chronos to utilize the full MarFanet V2Ray/Iran context when designing prompts for Vertex AI for the new dashboard.
