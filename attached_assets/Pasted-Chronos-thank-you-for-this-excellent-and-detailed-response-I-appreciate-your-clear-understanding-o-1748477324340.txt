Chronos, thank you for this excellent and detailed response. I appreciate your clear understanding of the UI/UX discrepancies and the plausible root cause analysis.

We will proceed with your **Option 1 (Preferred)** for providing current state information.

I will now go through each of the 9 key UI/UX points you re-summarized. For each point, I will:
1.  State the point we are addressing.
2.  Provide a link to a screenshot (or describe it if I can't link directly) showing how this aspect *currently looks* in the MarFanet application.
3.  Describe specifically what is wrong or how it deviates from the target `marfanet.com` aesthetic or our agreed-upon design principles for that point.

Please prepare to receive this information point-by-point. For each point I provide, I will expect you to:
    a. Analyze the provided screenshot and description of the current state.
    b. Propose specific and robust HTML/CSS (and JS if relevant) code changes to correct the issue and align it with the target design.
    c. Explain how your proposed solution ensures robustness (e.g., proper use of CSS variables, adherence to a component structure, good CSS practices).

Let's begin.

**Point 1: Overall Dark Theme Harmony**
*   **Target:** Deep blue backgrounds (e.g., #0A0F1E approximation) with a professional tech-focused aesthetic, consistent with the `marfanet.com` style.
*   **Current State Screenshot/Description for MarFanet App:**
    *   [**USER: INSERT LINK TO SCREENSHOT HERE OR DESCRIBE IN DETAIL.** Example: "The main background of the dashboard is currently a lighter gray #333333, not the deep blue. It lacks the sophisticated feel."]
*   **Specific Deviation:** [**USER: EXPLAIN WHAT'S WRONG.** Example: "The background color is entirely incorrect and doesn't match the #0A0F1E target. The overall feel is flat and not 'tech-focused' or 'premium'."]

**(Wait for Chronos's analysis and proposed solution for Point 1 before proceeding to Point 2, unless you want to give all 9 at once - point-by-point is usually better for focus).**
