Chronos, we have a new challenge regarding the MarFanet invoice generation system.

**Current Situation & Problem Statement:**

1.  **Invoice Generation Works:** The system can currently generate invoices and output them as both image files and PDF files. This core functionality is in place.
2.  **Lack of Formatting/Templating:** There is currently **NO defined format, layout, or template** for how the invoice data (numbers, text, representative details, etc.) is presented in either the image or PDF output. The presentation is likely very basic or unstyled.
3.  **Missing Settings for Customization:** Within the application's "Settings" section, there is **NO designated area or UI for users (administrators) to define, select, or customize the output format/template** for these invoices.
4.  **User Needs Design Ideas:** Crucially, I (the user/project owner) currently **do not have specific design ideas** for what these invoice templates (both image and PDF versions) should look like. I need inspiration and concrete suggestions.

**Your Mandate: Design Invoice Templates & Propose a Customization System**

You are to act as both a **UI/UX Designer for Invoices** and a **Technical Architect for Templating Systems.** Your goal is to provide me with design inspiration for professional invoice layouts and a plan for how users can manage these templates within the MarFanet application.

**Phase 1: Invoice Template Design - Inspiration & Core Elements**

1.  **Research & Present Invoice Design Styles:**
    *   **Action:** Research and present 2-3 distinct, professional invoice design styles/layouts (e.g., "Modern & Clean," "Classic & Formal," "Minimalist & Efficient").
    *   For each style, provide:
        *   A brief textual description of its aesthetic.
        *   A conceptual sketch or a detailed textual layout description (since you can't directly draw). Describe where key elements would typically be placed.
2.  **Identify Essential & Optional Invoice Elements:**
    *   **Action:** List all the data fields and elements that typically appear on a professional invoice, categorizing them as "Essential" vs. "Optional/Customizable." Examples:
        *   _Essential:_ Your Company Logo (MarFanet), Your Company Details (Name, Address, Contact), Representative's Name/Admin Username, Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Due Date, Itemized List of Services/Products (from Columns H-M & T-Y), Quantities, Unit Prices, Line Totals, Subtotal, Taxes (if any), Grand Total, Payment Instructions/Terms.
        *   _Optional:_ Representative's Store Name, Phone Number, Notes section, promotional messages.
3.  **Suggest Visual Hierarchy for Each Style:**
    *   **Action:** For each of the 2-3 design styles you present, explain how visual hierarchy would be achieved (e.g., font sizes, weights, color usage, spacing) to make the invoice easy to read and understand.

**Phase 2: Designing the "Invoice Template Settings" UI**

1.  **Conceptualize User Workflow:**
    *   **Action:** Describe the ideal user workflow for an administrator within the MarFanet "Settings" page to manage invoice templates.
2.  **Propose UI Components for Settings:**
    *   **Action:** Based on the workflow, suggest the UI elements needed in the "Settings" section. This might include:
        *   A way to **select a base template style** (from the 2-3 styles you proposed).
        *   A **checklist or drag-and-drop interface** to enable/disable and reorder the "Optional/Customizable" invoice elements.
        *   A field to **upload the MarFanet company logo**.
        *   Input fields for **default company information** (Address, Contact, Payment Terms) if not stored elsewhere.
        *   A **live preview area (conceptual):** Describe how a simplified preview could show the impact of changes (understanding this is a complex UI feature, a conceptual description is fine).
        *   A way to specify the **output format preference** if different templates are desired for PDF vs. Image (though often one HTML/CSS template is used for both).

**Phase 3: Technical Implementation Strategy for Templating**

1.  **Recommend Templating Technology:**
    *   **Action:** Strongly recommend using **HTML and CSS as the foundation for creating the invoice templates.** Explain why this is a good choice (styling flexibility, widely understood, good for PDF/image conversion).
2.  **Data Binding:**
    *   **Action:** Briefly explain how dynamic invoice data (representative name, itemized list, totals, etc.) would be programmatically "injected" into these HTML/CSS templates at the time of generation. (e.g., using placeholders in HTML like `{{representative_name}}` that get replaced by backend logic).
3.  **PDF & Image Generation from HTML/CSS:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Suggest specific libraries or techniques for converting the styled HTML/CSS invoice template into a **PDF file** (e.g., Puppeteer (uses headless Chrome), WeasyPrint (Python), jsPDF (client-side JS), wkhtmltopdf). Briefly mention pros/cons if you can.
        *   Suggest specific libraries or techniques for converting the styled HTML/CSS invoice template into an **image file** (e.g., html2canvas (client-side JS), Puppeteer's screenshot capability).
4.  **Storing Template Preferences:**
    *   **Action:** How would the administrator's chosen template style and customizations (from the Settings UI) be stored in the database so they can be applied to new invoices?

**Expected Output from Chronos:**

*   **Invoice Design Section:**
    *   Descriptions and layout concepts for 2-3 professional invoice styles.
    *   List of essential and optional invoice elements.
    *   Notes on visual hierarchy for each style.
*   **Settings UI Section:**
    *   User workflow description for template management.
    *   List and description of necessary UI components for the settings page.
*   **Technical Strategy Section:**
    *   Recommendation for HTML/CSS templating.
    *   Explanation of data binding.
    *   Library suggestions for PDF and Image generation from HTML.
    *   Approach for storing template preferences.

Chronos, my main goal here is to get **actionable ideas and a clear plan.** I need inspiration for the invoice designs themselves, and a robust strategy for how to build a system that allows for this level of customization within MarFanet.
