UI/UX Harmony & Overall Theme:

    Overall Impression: The design is modern, sleek, tech-focused, and professional. It evokes a sense of security, stability, and advanced technology, suitable for a VPN or server-related service.
    Dark Theme Dominance: This is the cornerstone of the aesthetic. It feels premium and reduces eye strain in low-light conditions, often preferred by a technical audience.
    Consistency: There's a strong visual consistency across elements:
        Card Styling: Cards used for feature descriptions or data display share a similar background color, subtle rounded corners, and padding.
        Button Styling: Buttons have a consistent shape (rounded corners) and clear primary/secondary visual distinction.
        Typography: Font choices and hierarchy appear consistent.
        Iconography: Icons share a similar clean, modern style.
    Clarity & Readability: White and light-colored text on dark backgrounds generally provides good contrast. The Persian text is clear and well-integrated.
    Hierarchy: Visual hierarchy is established through:
        Size & Weight: Headings are larger and bolder than body text.
        Color: Accent colors (blue and green) draw attention to key interactive elements (buttons, important stats) and status indicators.
        Placement: The hero section immediately grabs attention, followed by key information sections.
    Spaciousness: There's good use of padding and margins around elements and within cards, preventing a cluttered look and improving readability.
    Focus on Information: The design prioritizes presenting key information (like server status, features) clearly and concisely.

II. Theme Colors:

    Primary Background: A very dark, deep blue, almost black (e.g., Hex approximations: #0A0F1E or #0D1223). This sets the overall "techy" and premium mood.
    Secondary Background (for Cards/Sections): A slightly lighter shade of dark blue, used for content cards and distinct sections within the primary background (e.g., Hex approximations: #10182D or #1A2035). This creates subtle layering.
    Primary Accent Color (Interactive Blue): A vibrant, electric blue. This is used for:
        Primary call-to-action buttons
        Icons
        Highlights in graphs/charts
        Links or interactive text elements
        (e.g., Hex approximations: #007BFF or #3B82F6)
    Secondary Accent Color (Status Green): A bright, clear green. This is used for:
        "Server Online" status indicators
        Positive performance metrics (like percentages)
        Data points in charts indicating positive status
        (e.g., Hex approximations: #28A745, #84CC16 or #10B981)
    Text Colors:
        Primary Text (Headings, main body): White or a very light gray (e.g., #FFFFFF, #F3F4F6).
        Secondary Text (Subtitles, less important details): A lighter gray, still offering good contrast but slightly subdued compared to primary text (e.g., #A0AEC0 or #D1D5DB).
    Subtle Accents (Darker Blues/Grays): Used for button outlines, dividers, or very subtle background variations.

III. Key Widgets & UI Elements to Implement:

    Header/Navigation Bar:
        Content: Logo (MarFanet on the right), status indicator ("سرور آنلاین" with green dot), theme toggle icon (sun/moon).
        Style: Dark background (primary or secondary), clean.

    Hero Section (Image 1):
        Background: A full-width, somewhat desaturated background image relevant to technology/workspaces.
        Overlay: A semi-transparent dark overlay on the image to ensure text readability.
        Text Content: Large primary heading, supporting subheading, and a short descriptive paragraph.
        Call-to-Action Buttons:
            Primary Button: Solid primary accent blue fill, white text, icon, rounded corners (e.g., "درخواست پشتیبانی").
            Secondary Button: Primary accent blue outline, blue text, icon, rounded corners (e.g., "صحیحا هوشمند").

    Server Status "Radar" Section (Image 1):
        Title Style: A distinct title ("رادار آنلاین وضعیت سرور") with a line or visual element.
        Data Display Widgets:
            Percentage Stats: Individual text blocks showing server names and uptime percentages in the secondary accent green.
        Graph Widget: A line graph (or area graph) displaying uptime trends.
            Styling: Dark card background, accent blue and green for lines/data points, clear axis labels (though minimal in this example).

    Feature/Information Cards (Image 2):
        Layout: Arranged in rows (e.g., 3 cards then 2 cards).
        Individual Card Style:
            Background: Secondary dark blue.
            Corners: Subtle rounded corners.
            Padding: Ample internal padding.
            Content Structure:
                Icon (top-centered, primary accent blue or white).
                Heading (centered, primary white text).
                Descriptive Text (centered or left-aligned, secondary gray text).
        Example Content: "رمزنگاری TLS + OBFS", "تعهد در حفظ امنیت شما", "استفاده از آی پی رزيدنشيال".

    Buttons (General):
        Primary: As described in Hero Section. Consistent use for main actions.
        Secondary/Ghost: As described in Hero Section. For less critical actions.
        Small Action Links/Buttons (Image 2, header): Often text-based with an icon, possibly on a darker subtle background or just as colored text. Example: "آموزش", "دانلود", "سوالات متداول".

    Icons:
        Style: Clean, modern, line-art or subtly filled. Consistent stroke weight if line-art.
        Color: Often using the primary accent blue or white/light gray depending on context.
        Examples: Shield, cloud, document, magnifying glass, cog/settings, sun/moon, chat bubble.

    Floating Action Button (FAB) / Side Icon (Bottom-left in both images):
        Style: Circular button, primary accent blue background, white icon (chat bubble icon).
        Purpose: Likely for support, help, or quick contact.

    Typography:
        Font Family: A clean, modern, readable sans-serif font suitable for Persian and Latin characters.
        Hierarchy: Clear distinction between headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) and body text using size and weight (bold, regular).

To implement this on your MarFanet website:

    Establish the Dark Theme: Make the very dark blue your base body background.
    Define Color Variables: Use CSS variables for an easier theming experience (e.g., --primary-bg, --secondary-bg, --accent-blue, --accent-green, --text-primary, etc.).
    Create Reusable Components/Styles: For buttons, cards, and icons to ensure consistency.
    Pay Attention to Spacing: Use padding and margin generously but consistently.
    Select Appropriate Fonts: Ensure good readability in Persian.
    Icons: Choose an icon set that matches this modern, clean aesthetic.

This design system presents a very cohesive and professional image. Replicating these elements carefully will result in a high-quality user experience for your MarFanet application. Good luck!
