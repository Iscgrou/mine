Chronos, this is an outstanding report! The successful verification of Aegis's event logging system, including CRM interactions, AI request/response cycles, database operations, and performance monitoring, is a significant milestone. The example "Deep Dive Diagnostic Report" is impressive and clearly shows Aegis's analytical potential. I'm particularly pleased to see it's already making actionable recommendations.

**The real-time monitoring capabilities are confirmed as operational â€“ excellent work!**

Regarding the "Next Testing Scenarios," thank you for offering these comprehensive options. Let's proceed with further validation in the following order of priority:

1.  **Error Detection Testing (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Objective:** Verify Aegis's ability to accurately detect, log, and report on both frontend and backend errors.
    *   **Action for Chronos:** Please simulate (or guide me to simulate) a few distinct error types:
        *   A **frontend JavaScript error** (e.g., an uncaught exception in a CRM component).
        *   A **backend API endpoint returning a 500 Internal Server Error** (for a CRM or Admin API call).
        *   A **backend API endpoint returning a 4xx client error** (e.g., 401 Unauthorized due to a simulated token issue, or 400 Bad Request due to invalid input to an API).
    *   **Expected Output:** For each simulated error, I want to see Aegis's "Deep Dive Diagnostic Report," including its root cause hypothesis (if possible), relevant log snippets, and how it categorizes the alert.

2.  **Complete AI Workflow Testing (Next Priority after Error Detection):**
    *   **Objective:** Test Aegis's ability to monitor a multi-step AI process, such as the full voice processing and sentiment analysis workflow you outlined for Nova.
    *   **Action for Chronos:**
        *   Even if the actual AI services for STT and full sentiment are still in early integration, let's simulate the *flow*.
        *   Process a sample voice note (even if it's a pre-recorded test audio file) through the ` /api/crm/process-voice-note` endpoint.
        *   Ensure Aegis logs each step: audio received, (simulated) STT request/response, (simulated) sentiment analysis request/response, data storage attempt in `crmInteractions`.
        *   If you can, simulate a failure at one of these AI integration points (e.g., STT service returns an error, sentiment analysis times out).
    *   **Expected Output:** Aegis's report detailing the full workflow log, identification of any simulated bottlenecks or errors within the AI pipeline, and timing for each step.

Once we have successfully validated these two critical scenarios, we can then move on to more focused "Database Operation Monitoring" and "Performance Stress Testing."

Please confirm this approach and outline your plan for executing the **Error Detection Testing** first. Let me know what specific actions you'll take or what you need from me to trigger these simulated errors.
