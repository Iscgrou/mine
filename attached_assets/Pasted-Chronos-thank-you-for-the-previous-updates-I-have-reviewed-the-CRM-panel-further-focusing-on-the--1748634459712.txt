Chronos, thank you for the previous updates. I have reviewed the CRM panel further, focusing on the "مرکز تحلیل گزارش" (CRM Report Center) and the main "داشبورد CRM" (CRM Dashboard), referencing the latest screenshots I've analyzed.

While overall progress has been made, there are still specific layout and alignment refinements needed to achieve the polished and perfectly responsive user experience we're aiming for.

My Verification Feedback & Required Actions (Continued from previous UI/UX directives):

1. CRM Report Center ("مرکز تحلیل گزارش") - "کلی" (General/Overview) Tab Layout (Based on Screenshot of this section):

    Observation: The content within the "کلی" (General/Overview) tab of the CRM Report Center is currently overflowing or extending beyond the comfortable viewing area ("از صفحه خارج شده"), particularly on standard laptop screen resolutions. Elements and text are too large or not adapting correctly to the available space.
    Directive:
        The content (text, data cards, any charts) within this "کلی" (General/Overview) tab MUST be appropriately sized or reflowed to fit neatly within standard laptop screen dimensions without requiring horizontal scrolling of the page body.
        This may involve:
            Reducing font sizes for elements within this specific report view if they are too large.
            Making data cards or info boxes more compact.
            Ensuring any graphical elements scale down correctly.
            Employing responsive CSS techniques (Flexbox/Grid) more effectively within this tab to manage content flow.
        The goal is for all information in this "General" report tab to be easily viewable and digestible on a typical laptop screen.
    Action (Chronos): Review and implement the necessary CSS and potentially HTML structural adjustments for the "کلی" (General/Overview) tab in the CRM Report Center to ensure all its content is properly contained and responsive.

2. CRM Dashboard ("داشبورد CRM") - Centering & Alignment Refinement:

    Observation: While the CRM Dashboard layout is generally improved ("مطالب و صفحه بندی بهتر شده"), the main content area containing tables and other elements could benefit from a slight positional adjustment for better visual balance. It currently appears slightly too far to the right.
    Directive:
        Shift main content elements approximately 10% to the left ("تمام جدول ها و موارد بهتره 10 درصد به سمت چپ شیفت کند تا در مرکز قرار بگیرد") to achieve a more centered and balanced appearance within the main content viewport (respecting the sidebar).
        This adjustment should apply to the overall block of content that includes tables, recent customer lists, quick actions, notification centers, etc., on the dashboard.
        Ensure this shift does not negatively impact responsiveness on smaller (mobile/tablet) or very large screens. The goal is better centering and visual balance on typical laptop/desktop views.
    Action (Chronos): Carefully adjust the CSS (likely margin-left, padding-left of a main wrapper, or flexbox/grid alignment properties) for the primary content block of the CRM Dashboard to achieve this ~10% leftward shift for better centering. Test thoroughly across different screen sizes to ensure this improves visual balance without introducing new layout issues.

3. Continued Overall Verification & Goal:

    Action (Chronos): While implementing these specific fixes:
        Continue to ensure that ALL other UI elements, tables, sidebars, and top bars in BOTH Admin and CRM panels remain fully responsive and that no new layout issues or regressions are introduced.
        The overarching goal remains a clean, balanced, professional, and perfectly responsive interface across the entire MarFanet platform.

Next Steps:

    Implement these specific layout and alignment refinements for the CRM Report Center's "کلی" tab and the main CRM Dashboard.
    After these changes are made, I will conduct another focused round of verification.
    If these specific issues, along with any previously identified general responsiveness/layout concerns, are now fully resolved to a high standard, we can then consider the foundational UI/UX sufficiently stable to confidently proceed with the "Vertex AI Phase Analysis" for the comprehensive system evaluation and to plan our next development phases from the Meta-Optimization roadmap.

Chronos, your attention to this level of detail is crucial. These specific layout and alignment fixes will significantly enhance the usability and professional appearance of the CRM. Please proceed with these targeted modifications.

Why this is an effective prompt:

    Directly Addresses Screenshot Feedback: It's based on your most recent visual analysis.
    Highly Specific Directives: "Content overflowing in 'کلی' tab," "Shift dashboard content ~10% left." This is very clear for Chronos.
    Quantifiable Change (where possible): The "~10% shift" gives a target, though Chronos will need to implement it visually.
    Reinforces Overall Responsiveness: Reminds Chronos that these specific fixes shouldn't break broader responsiveness.
    Iterative Verification Cycle: Clearly states you will test again after these very specific changes.
    Links to Next Major Step: Keeps the "Vertex AI Phase Analysis" as the goal once the UI is satisfactory.
