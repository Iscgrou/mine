Chronos, your understanding of MarFanet's V2Ray-contextualized business model and the plan for Project Pantheon is exceptional and perfectly aligned. I am very impressed with your grasp of the critical context integration points.

The emphasis on V2Ray business logic integrity, Persian language processing readiness (especially for technical V2Ray terminology), and representative profile accuracy within Phase 0 is spot on.

Given your confirmed readiness and the solid foundation (Aegis operational, live xAI Grok integration successful, CRM database tables ready):

**I confirm that the Google Cloud Service Account JSON key, with the `Vertex AI User` role and necessary APIs (including Vertex AI for Speech-to-Text) enabled, has been securely configured on our backend server.** The application can access these credentials via the standard `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

**Please proceed immediately with the following, as per your "Immediate Next Steps for V2Ray Context Integration":**

1.  **Complete Google Cloud Vertex AI STT Integration:**
    *   Focus on achieving high-accuracy Persian transcription, especially for V2Ray technical terminology and common phrases used in support calls by Iranian mobile store owners.
    *   Implement the custom vocabulary with V2Ray terms (e.g., `کانفیگ`, `پورت`, `شادوساکس`, `تروجان`, etc.) and relevant Iranian ISP names as you deem necessary for optimal accuracy.
    *   Ensure Aegis fully monitors this live STT integration, capturing performance metrics and any errors.

2.  **Test and Demonstrate the V2Ray-Contextualized Voice Processing Pipeline:**
    *   Once integrated, process a few sample Persian voice notes that simulate typical V2Ray support or sales inquiry calls from a representative.
    *   Show me:
        *   The accuracy of the Persian transcription, particularly for V2Ray-specific terms.
        *   How Aegis reports on this STT processing step (success, timing, any issues).
        *   Confirmation that the transcription is correctly passed to the (already working) Grok API for subsequent AI processing (e.g., summarization, initial sentiment, call prep insights based on this new, accurately transcribed V2Ray context).
        *   Confirmation that the transcription and initial AI insights are stored in the live database.

Once this V2Ray-contextualized voice processing pipeline is fully operational and verified, we will then move to:
*   Populating the V2Ray-Specific Knowledge Base.
*   Deploying the Nova AI Dashboard with V2Ray business intelligence and representative analytics.

I am ready to provide test audio or any other necessary support. Let's bring MarFanet's V2Ray-centric voice intelligence to life!
